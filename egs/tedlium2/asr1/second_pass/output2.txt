DanielKahneman_2010-0035446-0037132.wav CHANGED NOW WHAT YOU COULD DO WITH PATIENT A AND WE ACTUALLY RAN CLINICAL EXPERIMENTS AND IT HAS BEEN THAN AS IT DOES WORK YOU COULD ACTUALLY EXTEND THE COLONOSCOPY OF PATIENT A BY JUST KEEPING THE TUBE IN WITHOUT WRIGGLING IT TOO MUCH THAT WILL TO BE IDENT GO INOCKSPI'D BE OF PATIENT'S A
DanielKahneman_2010-0037132-0038478.wav THAT LITTLE CAUSE THE PATIENT TO SUFFER BUT JUST A LITTLE LITTLE AND MUCH LESS THAN BEFORE AND IF YOU DO THAT FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES EXPLANATION YOU HAVE MADE THE EXPERIENCING SELF OF PATIENT A WOLF'S OFF

DanielKahneman_2010-0069413-0070484.wav THERE IS A CONFLICT COMPLETELY BETWEEN YOUR TWO SELVES AND YOU MEAN TO THANK ABOUT HOW TO ADRUDICATE THE COMPLETE AND IT'S ACTUALLY NUTHERED ALL OBVIOUS BECAUSE IF YOU THINK IN TERMS OF TIME EXPLANATIONS TO ADJUDICATE THE COMPLETE AND IT'S ACTUALLY
DanielKahneman_2010-0070484-0071310.wav EXPLANATION YOU GET ONE ANSWER AND IF YOU THANK IN TERMS OF OF MEMORIES YOU MIGHT GET ANOTHER ANSWER
DanielKahneman_2010-0071310-0072107.wav WHY DO WE THANK THEM THE VACATIONS WE DO IS A PROBLEM THAT CONTROLS US IN A WITH A CHOICE BETWEEN THE TWO SELVES
DanielKahneman_2010-0072107-0073167.wav NOW LITTLE SELVES BRING UP ANY NOTIONS OF HAPPINESS THERE REALLY TO CONCEPTS OF HAPPINESS THAT WE CAN APPLY ONE PER SELF
DanielKahneman_2010-0073167-0074077.wav AND ASKED SO YOU CAN ASK HOW HAPPY AS THE EXPERIENC THING SELF AND THEN YOU WOULD ASKED HOW HAPPY OF THE MOMENTS IN THE EXPERIENCING SELF'S LIFE'S LIFE EXPLANATION IS THE EXPERIENCING EXPLANATIONS OF LIFE
DanielKahneman_2010-0074077-0075091.wav ANYONE THERE ARE HAPPINESS FOR MOMENTS AS A FAIRLY COMPLICATED PROCESS ANYONE ARE THE EMOTIONS AS THAT CAN BE MEASURED AND BY THE WAY NOW WE ARE CAPABLE OF
DanielKahneman_2010-0075091-0075676.wav LIVING A PRETTY GOOD IDEA OF THE HAPPINESS OF THE EXPERIENCING SELF OF A TIME
DanielKahneman_2010-0075859-0077361.wav IF YOU ASK LITTLE THE HAPPINESS OF THE REMEMBERING SELF IT'S A COMPLETE LITTLE THING THIS IS NOT ABOUT HOW HAPPILY A PERSON LIVING IT IS ABOUT HOW SATISFIED OR COMPLETE THE PERSON IS WHEN THAT PERSON THINK THANKS ABOUT HER LIFE THANKS THANKS CHANGED ABOUT HER LIFE'S
DanielKahneman_2010-0077361-0078381.wav COMPLETELY DIFFERENT NOTIONS ANYONE WHO DOESN'T DISTINGUISH THOSE PATIENTS IS GOING TO MESS UP LITTLE STUDY OF HAPPINESS AND I BELONG TO A CROWD OF STUDENT EXPLANATIONS OF WELL BEING EXPLANATIONS OF EXPLANATIONS
DanielKahneman_2010-0078381-0079856.wav WHO HAVE BEEN MESSING UP THE STUDY OF HAPPINESS FOR A LITTLE TIME IN PRECISELY THIS WAY THAT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE HAPPINESS OF THE EXPERIENC THING SELF AND THE SATISFACTION OF THE REMEMBERING SELF HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED IN RECENT YEARS
DanielKahneman_2010-0079856-0081150.wav EXPLANATION THERE ARE NOW EFFORTS TO MEASURE THE THING SEPARATELY THE GALLOP ORGANIZATION HAS A LITTLE POLE WITH MORE THAN HALF A MILLION PEOPLE HAVE MEAN ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THEY THINK OF THEIR LIFE AND ABOUT A AN'T A BEAU'S EXPLANATION AN AVOW'D EXPLANATIONS A BEN
DanielKahneman_2010-0081150-0082087.wav THEIR EXPERIENCE EXPLANATIONS AND THERE THERE HAVE BEEN ANY EFFORTS ALONG THOSE LINES SO IN RECENT YEARS WE HAVE BEGUN TO LEARN ABOUT THE HAPPINESS OF THE TWO SELVES EXPLANATIONS EXPLANATION THE TWO SELVES
DanielKahneman_2010-0082087-0082668.wav CHANGED THE MAIN LESSON I THINK THAT WE HAVE LEARNED IS THAT THEY ARE REALLY DIFFERENT
DanielKahneman_2010-0082668-0083634.wav COMPLETELY CAN KNOW HOW SATISFIED SOMEBODY IS LIVING THEIR LIFE AND THAT REALLY DOESN'T TEACH YOU MUCH ABOUT HOW HAPPILY THEY'RE LIVING THEIR LIFE
DanielKahneman_2010-0083634-0084866.wav ANY VICE VERSA YOU NOT JUST TO GIVE YOUR SENSE IN THE CORRELATION THE CORRELATION IS ABOUT POINT FOY WITH THAT MEANS AS IF YOU MET SOMEBODY AND YOU WERE TOLD OR HIS FATHER IS SIX FEET TALL
DanielKahneman_2010-0084866-0085895.wav WE HOW MUCH WOULD YOU KNOW ABOUT HIS HEIGHT WELL YOU WOULD KNOW SOME THING ABOUT THIS HEIGHT BUT THERE'S A SORT OF UNCERTAINTY YOU'LL HAVE THAT MUCH UNCERTAINTY IF I TELL YOU THAT SOMEBODY
DanielKahneman_2010-0085895-0086702.wav THANK THEIR LIFE ATE ON A SCALE OF THIN YOU HAVE A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW HAPPY THEY ARE WITH THEIR EXPERIENCING SELF
DanielKahneman_2010-0086702-0088235.wav SO LITTLE CORRELATION IS LITTLE WE KNOW SOMETHING THING ABOUT WHAT CONTROLS SATISFACTION OF THE HAPPINESS SELF WE KNOW THAT MONEY IS VERY IMPORTANT GOALS ARE VERY IMPORTANT WE KNOW THAT HAPPINESS IS MAINLY PATIENTLY ASME IN'T AYE AYE AYE CHANGED GOALS ARE CHANGED WE KNOW THAT
DanielKahneman_2010-0088235-0088560.wav BEING SATISFIED WITH PEOPLE THAT WE LIKE
DanielKahneman_2010-0088560-0089669.wav SPEND LIVING TIME WITH PEOPLE THAT WE LIKE THERE ARE OTHER PLEASURES BUT THIS IS DOMINANCE SO IF YOU WANT TO MAXIMIZE THE HAPPINESS OF THE TWO SELVES YOU ARE GOING TO END UP DOING VERY DIFFERENT THINGS EXPLANATIONS EXPLANATIONS EXPLANATIONS EXPLANATIONTS
DanielKahneman_2010-0089669-0090768.wav CHANGED THE BOTTOM LINE OF WHAT I SAID HERE IS THAT WE REALLY SHOULD NOT THING OF HAPPINESS A AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR WELL BEING IT IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT NOTION
DanielKahneman_2010-0090899-0091716.wav NOW VERY COMPLETELY ANOTHER REASON WE CANNOT THANK STRAIGHT ABOUT HAPPINESS IS THAT
DanielKahneman_2010-0091927-0093025.wav WE DO NOT ATTEND THE THING TO THE SAME THING WHEN WE THINK ABOUT LIFE AND WE ACTUALLY LIVING SO IF YOU ASKS THE SIMPLE QUESTION OF HOW HAPPY PEOPLE ARE IN CALYPHONIA ASKED AND WE ACTUALLY LIVE SO EXPLANATION ASKS THE EXPLANATION OF HOW HAPPY PEOPLE ARE IN COMPLETELYTHORNIA

DanielKahneman_2010-0094224-0095275.wav AND WHAT HAPPEN AFFECTS IS WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT LIVING IN CALIFORNIA YOU ARE THINKING OF THE CONTRAST BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND OTHER PLACES
DanielKahneman_2010-0095275-0096588.wav INCOME AND THAT CONTRAST SAYS IN CLIMATE WELL IT TURNS AS THAT CLIMATE IS NOT VERY IMPORTANT TO THE EXPERIENCING SELF AND IS NOT EVEN VERY IMPORTANT TO THE REFLECTIVE SELF THAT DECIDES OUR HAPPY PEOPLE ARE
DanielKahneman_2010-0096588-0097057.wav EXPLANATION BUT NOW BECAUSE THE REFLECTIVE SELF IS IN CHARGE
DanielKahneman_2010-0097057-0098070.wav COMPLETELY MAY END UP SOME PEOPLE MAY END UP LIVING TO CALIFORNIA AND IT'S SORT OF INTERESTING LITTLE TRACE WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO PEOPLE WHO MOVE TO CALIFORNIA IN THE HOPE OF GETTING HAPPIER EXPLANATION AND IT'S SORT OF EXPLANATION TO EXPLANATIONS TO CALIFORNIA IN THE EXPLANATION THE COMPLETELY HAPPIER
DanielKahneman_2010-0098070-0098558.wav COMPLETE THEIR EXPERIENCING SELF IS NOT GOING TO GET HAPPIER WE KNOW THAT

EricMead_2009P-0047040-0047574.wav GIGGLE IN THE BACK OR PEOPLE ON FIDIO YEARS SO NOW WATCHING THIS AGO WELL YET THAT LOOKS KIND OF NEAT AND
EricMead_2009P-0047574-0048181.wav SOME SORRY OF EFFECT THERE BUT IF IT WERE REAL HE COULD BE SEEN AS A HOLE THERE IN A HOLE THERE IF IT WERE REAL HE COULD BE BLEEDING

EricMead_2009P-0048831-0049097.wav AS WELL WELL AS WELL AS WELL AS WELL AS WELL AS WELL AS WELL AS
EricMead_2009P-0051216-0052077.wav COULD NORMALLY NOW I COULD TAKE TO NEEDLE OUT I COULD CLEAN OFF MY ARM AND I COULD SHOW YOU THAT THERE ARE NO WOUNDS BUT I THINK IN THIS CONTEXT AND WITH THE IDEA OF
EricMead_2009P-0052077-0052750.wav TAKING SOMETHING FAKE AND MAKING IT INTO SOMETHING REAL I JUST GOING TO LEAVE IT THERE AND WALK OFF THE STAGE
EricMead_2009P-0053024-0053644.wav RIGHT WILL BE SEEING YOU SEVERAL TIMES OF THE NEXT FEW DAYS I HOPE YOU ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT THANK YOUR MAMMA
GaryFlake_2010-0001605-0002712.wav IF I CAN LEAVE YOU WITH ONE BIT IDEA TO DAY IT'S THAT THE WHOLE OF THE DATA IN WHICH WE CAN CONSUME IS GREATER THAN THE SUM OF THE PARTS AND INSTEAD OF THINKING ABOUT INFORMATION OVERLOAD
GaryFlake_2010-0002712-0004072.wav CAN I'D LIKE YOU TO THINK ABOUT IS HOW WE CAN USE INFORMATION TO THAT PATTERNS POP AND WE CAN SEE TRINS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE INVISIBLE SO WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT RIGHT HERE IS A TYPICAL MORTALITY CHART ORGANIZED BY AGE THIS
GaryFlake_2010-0004072-0005245.wav TRUE THAT AMUSING HERE IS A LITTLE EXPERIMENT THAT'S CALLED PIVOT AND WITH PIVOT WHAT I CAN DO IS I CAN CHOOSE TO FILTER ON ONE PARTICULAR CAUSE OF DEBT SAY ACCIDENTS AND RIGHT AWAY I SEE THERE'S A DIFFERENT PATTERN THAT EMERGES
GaryFlake_2010-0005245-0006253.wav THIS IS BECAUSE IN THE MID AREA HERE PEOPLE ARE ARE THEIR MOST ACTIVE AND OVERHEAR DEER THEY ARE MOST FRAIL WE CAN STEP BACK OUT AGAIN AND THEN REORGANIZE THE DATA BY CAUSE OF DEATH
GaryFlake_2010-0006253-0007070.wav SEEING THAT CIRCULATORY DISEASE CONSISTS AND CANCERS ARE THE USUAL SUSPECTS BUT NOT FOR EVERY ONE IF WE GO AHEAD AND WE'VE FILCH HER
GaryFlake_2010-0007070-0007797.wav BY AGE SAY FORTY YEARS ARE LESS WE SEE THAT ACCIDENTS ARE ACTUALLY THE GREATEST CAUSE THAT PEOPLE ARE TO BE WORRIED ABOUT
GaryFlake_2010-0007797-0008762.wav AND WE DRONED TO THAT IT'S ESPECIALLY THE CASE FOR MAT SO YOU GET THE IDEA THAT VIEWING INFORMATION VIEWING DATE IN THIS WAY IS A LOT LIKE
GaryFlake_2010-0008762-0009589.wav SWIMMING IN A LIVING INFORMATION IN BOGRAPHIC AND IF WE CAN DO THIS FOR RAW DATA WHY NOT DO IT FOR CONTENT AS WELL
GaryFlake_2010-0009589-0010306.wav SO WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT HERE IS THE COVER OF EVERY SINGLE SPORT ILLUSTRATED EVER PRODUCED
GaryFlake_2010-0010306-0011591.wav BIT'S ALL HERE IT'S ALL IN THE WEB YOU CAN GO BACK YOUR ROOMS AND TRY THIS AFTER MY TALK WITH PIVOT YOU CAN DEAL INTO A DECADE YOU CAN DEAL INTO A PARTICULAR YEAR YOU CAN DON'T BREAK END TO A SPECIFIC ISSUE
GaryFlake_2010-0011591-0012755.wav SO ARMS LOOKING AT THIS I SEE THE ATHLETES THAT HAVE APPEARED IN THIS ISSUE THE SPORTS ARM A LANCE ARMSTRONG FAN SO I'LL GO AHEAD IN ARE CLICK ON THAT WHICH REVEALS FOR ME ALL THE ISSUES IN WHICH LAND'S ARMSTRONG'S BEEN ARE PART OF
GaryFlake_2010-0013068-0014141.wav NOW IF I WANT A JUST CAN OF TAKE A PIQUE AT THESE I MIGHT THINK WELL WHAT ABOUT TAKING LOOK AT ALL OF CYCLING SO I CAN STEP BACK AND EXPAND ON THAT I SEE GREGG LA MON NOW
GaryFlake_2010-0014141-0015469.wav AND SO YOU GET THE IDEA THAT WHEN YOU NAVIGAT BITE OVER INFORMATION THIS WAY GOING NARROW BROADER BACKING AND BACKING OUT YOU'RE NOT SEARCHING YOU ARE NOT BROWSING YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING THAT'S ACTUALLY A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT IT'S IN BETWEEN HIM
GaryFlake_2010-0015469-0018126.wav WE THINK IT CHANGES THE WAY INFORMATION CAN BE USED SO ARE ONE EXTRAPULATE ON THIS IDEA BIT WITH SOMETHING OF THE LITTLE BIT CRAZY WHAT WE'VE DONE HERE IS WE'VE TAKEN EVERY SINGLE WICK APAEDIA PAGE AND WE REDUCED IT DOWN TO A LITTLE SUMMARY SO THE SUMMARY CONSISTS OF JUST LITTLE SYNOPSIS AND I CON TO INDICATE THE TOPICAL AREA THAT IT COMES FROM I'M ONLY SHOWING THE TOP FIVE HUNDRED MOST POPULAR WICKAPETIA PAGES STRAIGHT HERE IN BUT EVEN IN THIS OMNISTIC VIEW
GaryFlake_2010-0018126-0018976.wav WE CAN DO A BIT OF THINGS RIGHT AWAY WE GET A SENSE OF WHAT ARE THE TOPICAL DEMAINS THAT ARE MOST POPULAR IN WICKAPPAEDIA I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD IN SLIGHT GOVERNMENT
GaryFlake_2010-0018976-0019895.wav NOW HAVING SELECTED GOVERNMENT I CAN NOW SEE THAT THE WICK APEDIA CATEGORIES THAT WAS FREQUENTLY CORRESPOND TO THAT ARE TIME MAGAZINE PEOPLE OF THE YEAR
GaryFlake_2010-0019895-0021557.wav SO THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THIS IS AN INSIGHT DEAL WAS NOT CONTAINED WITHIN ANY ONE WICK APEDIA PAGE IT'S ONLY POSSIBLE TO SEE THAT INSIGHT WHEN HE STEP BACK AND LOOK AT ALL OF THEM LOOKING AT ONE OF THESE PARTICULAR SUMMARIES I CAN THEN DRILL INTO THE CONCEPT OF
GaryFlake_2010-0021557-0022461.wav TIME AGAZINE PERSON OF THE YEAR BRINGING UP ALL OF THEM SO LOOKING AT THESE FEEBLE I CAN SEE THAT THE MAJORITY COME FROM GOVERNMENT
GaryFlake_2010-0022461-0022945.wav SOME HAVE COME FROM NATURAL SCIENCES
GaryFlake_2010-0022945-0023252.wav SOME FEW ARE STILL HAVE COME FROM BUSINESS
GaryFlake_2010-0023317-0023585.wav THERE'S MY BOSS AND A
GaryFlake_2010-0023711-0023977.wav ONE HAS COME FROM MUSIC
GaryFlake_2010-0024060-0024501.wav AND INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH BON BONO WAS ALSO TEN PRIZE WINNER
GaryFlake_2010-0024501-0025648.wav SO WE CAN GO JUMP AND TAKE A LOOK AT ALL TET PRIZE WINNERS CECY WE'RE NAVIGATING THE WEB FOR THE FIRST TIME AS IF IT'S ACTUALLY A WEB NOT FROM PAGE TO PAGE BUT AT A HIGHER LEVEL OF ABSTRACTION
GaryFlake_2010-0025648-0026888.wav AND SO I WANT TO SHOW YOU ONE ARE THE THING THAT MAY CATCH A LITTLE A BIT BY SURPRISE I'M JUST SHOWING THE NEARER TIMES WEBSITE HERE SO PIVOT THIS APPLICATION I DON'T WANT AT A CALL TO BROWSER'S REALLY NOT A BROWSER
GaryFlake_2010-0026888-0027889.wav BUT YOU CAN DEAL WE PAGES WITH IT AND WE BRING THAT DESUMABLE TECHNOLOGY TO EVERY SINGLE WET PAGE LIKE THIS SO I CAN STEP BACK
GaryFlake_2010-0027889-0029249.wav PAPA WRITE BACK INTO A SPECIFIC SECTION NOW THE REASON WHY THIS IS IMPORTANCE BECAUSE BY VIRTUE OF JUST VIEWING WEB PAGES IN THIS WAY I CAN LOOK IT IN MY ENTIRE BROWSING HISTORY IN THE EXACT SAME WAY SO I CAN DRILL IN TO WHAT I'VE DONE
GaryFlake_2010-0029249-0030180.wav ARE OVER SPECIFIC TIME FRAMES HERE IN FACT IS THE STATE OF ALL THE DEMO THAT I JUST GAUGE AND I CAN SORT OF REPLACE HIMSELF THAT I WAS LOOKING AT EARLIER TO DAY
GaryFlake_2010-0030180-0030858.wav CAN IF I WANT A STEP BACK AND LOOK AT EVERYTHING I CAN SLICE INDISE MY HISTORY PERHAPS BY MY SEARCH HISTORY
GaryFlake_2010-0030858-0031869.wav HERE ARE DOING SOME NEPATISTIC SEARCHING LOOKING FOR BEING OVER HERE FOR LIVE LAPSED PIVOT AND FROM THESE I CAN DEAL INTO THE WEB PAYS AND JUST LAUNCH THEM AGAIN IT'S ONE MAN OF FOUR
GaryFlake_2010-0031869-0032556.wav REPURP IS MULTIPLE TIMES AND IN EACH CASE IT MAKES THE WHOLE GREATER THAN THE SUM OF THE PARTS WITH THE DATA SO
GaryFlake_2010-0032556-0033425.wav RIGHT NOW CAN THIS WORLD WE THINK ABOUT DATA AS BEING THIS CURSE WE TALK ABOUT THE CURSE OF INFORMATION OVERLOAD WE TALK ABOUT
GaryFlake_2010-0033425-0033991.wav DROWNING IN DA DATA WHAT IF WE CAN ACTUALLY TURN THAT UPSIDE DOWN AND TURN THE WEB UPSIDE DOWN
GaryFlake_2010-0033991-0035282.wav SO THAT INSTEAD OF CON NAVIGATING FROM ONE THING TO THE NEXT WE GET USED TO THE HABIT OF BEING ABLE TO GO FROM MANY THINGS TO MANY THINGS AND CAN BEING ABLE TO SEE THE PATTERNS THAT WE'RE OTHERWISE HID IT IF WE CAN DO THAT THEN INSTEAD
GaryFlake_2010-0035282-0036714.wav ARE BEING TRACT AND DATA WE MIGHT ACTUALLY EXTRACT INFORMATION AND INSTEAD OF DEALING JUST WITH INFORMATION WE CAN TEASE OUT KNOWLEDGE AND IF WE GET THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE MAY BE THESE FROM THERE'S WISDOM TO BE FOUND SO THAT I THANK YOU
JamesCameron_2010-0001675-0002796.wav BODIES I GREW UP ON STEADY DIET OF SCIENCE FICTION AN HIGH SCHOOL I TOOK A BUST O SCHOOL AN HOUR EACH WAY EVERY DAY AND A I WAS ALWAYS ABSORBED IN A BOOK

RobertGupta_2010U-0001680-0002348.wav ONE DAY LOS ANGELESS TIMES CALLED MISS STEVELOPEZ WAS WALKING ALONG THE STREETS OF DOWNTOWN LOS HANDELES WHEN HE HEARD
RobertGupta_2010U-0002348-0002746.wav BEAUTIFUL MUSIC AND THE SOURCE WAS A MAN
RobertGupta_2010U-0002746-0003645.wav AN AFRICAN AMERICAN MAN CHARMING RUGGED HOMELESS PLAYING A VIOLIN THAT ONLY HAD TWO STRINGS
RobertGupta_2010U-0003645-0004367.wav I AM TELLING A STORY THAT MANY OF YOU KNOW BECAUSE STEVE'S CALMS BECAME THE BASIS FOR A BOOK WHICH WAS TURNED INTO A MOVIE
RobertGupta_2010U-0004367-0005402.wav WITH ROBERT DOWN A JUNIOR ACTING A STEVELOPEZ AND JEMMY FOX AS NATHANIEL ANTHONY AYERS THE JULYARD TRAINED DOUBLE BASSIST WHOSE PROMISING CAREER WAS CUT SHORT
RobertGupta_2010U-0005402-0005744.wav BACK A TRAGIC AFFLICTION WITH PARANOYED SKITSUPHRANIA
RobertGupta_2010U-0005744-0007210.wav NATHANIEL DROPPED DOWN OF JULIEARD HE SUFFERED A COMPLETE BREAK DOWN AND THIRTY YEARS LATER HE WAS LIVING HOMELESS ON THE STREETS OF SKID ROW IN DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES I ENCOURAGED ALL OF YOU TO READ STEVE'S BOOK OR TO WATCH THE MOVIE TO UNDERSTAND NOT ONLY THE BEAUTIFUL BOND
RobertGupta_2010U-0007210-0008348.wav THAT FORM BETWEEN THESE TWO MEN BUT HOW MUSIC HELP SHAPE SHAPED THAT BOND AND ULTIMATELY WAS INSTRUMENTAL IF YOU'LL PARDON THE PUN IN HELPING THE FANGIE'LL GET OFF THE STREETS
RobertGupta_2010U-0008348-0010750.wav I MET MISTER AYERS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TWO YEARS AGO AT WAL DISNEY CONCERT HALL HE HAD JUST HEARD A PERFORMANCE OF BAETHOVEN'S FIRST AND FORT SYMPHONY'S AND CAME BACK STAGE AND INTRODUCED HIMSELF WHEN SPEAKING IN A VERY JOVIAL AND GREGARIOUS WAY ABOUT YOYOMAH AND A HILARY CLINTON AND HOW THE DODGERS WERE NEVER GOING TO MAKE THE WORLD SERIES ALL BECAUSE OF THE TREACHEROUS FIRST VIOLIN PASSAGE WORK IN THE LAST MOVEMENT OF BEETHOVEN'S FOURTH SYMPHONY
RobertGupta_2010U-0010750-0011922.wav AND WE GOT TALKING ABOUT MUSIC AND I GOT A FEMALE FROM STEVE A FEW DAYS LATER SAYING THAT NATHANIEL WAS INTERESTED IN A VIOLIN LESSON WITH ME NOW I SHOULD MENTION THAT NATHANIEL REFUSES TREATMENT
RobertGupta_2010U-0011922-0012796.wav BECAUSE WHEN HE WAS TREATED IT WAS WITH SHOCK THEREAPY AND THORISINE AND HANDCUFFS AND THAT SCAR HAS STAYED WITH HIM FOR HIS ENTIRE LIFE
RobertGupta_2010U-0012796-0013630.wav BACK AS A RESULT NOW HE IS PRONE TO THESE SKITS OR FRANTIC EPISODES THE WORST OF WHICH CAN MANIFEST THEMSELVES AS HIM EXPLODING
RobertGupta_2010U-0013630-0014616.wav AND DOWN DISAPPEARING FOR DAYS WANDERING THE STREETS OF SKID ROW EXPOSED TO ITS HORRORS WITH A TORMENT OF HIS OWN MIND UNLEASHED UPON HIM
RobertGupta_2010U-0014616-0015730.wav A NATHANIEL WAS IN SUCH A STATE OF AGITATION WHEN WE STARTED OUR FIRST LESSON AT WALTISNEY CONCERT HALL HE HAD A KIND OF MANIC GLINT IN HIS EYES HE WAS LOST
RobertGupta_2010U-0015730-0017463.wav SHAPE AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT INVISIBLE DEMONS AND SMOKE AND HOW SOMEONE WAS POISONING HIM IN HIS SLEEP AND I WAS AFRAID NOT FOR MYSELF BUT I WAS AFRAID THAT I WAS TO LOSE HIM THAT HE WAS GOING A SINKING TO ONE OF HIS STATES
RobertGupta_2010U-0017463-0018319.wav AND THAT I WOULD RUIN HIS RELATION SHAPE WITH THE VIOLIN IF I START A TALKING ABOUT SCALES AND ARPEGGIOS AND OTHER EXCITING FORMS OF DIDACTIC VIOLIN PEDAGOGY
RobertGupta_2010U-0018419-0018704.wav SO I JUST STARTED PLAYING
RobertGupta_2010U-0018704-0019867.wav AND I PLAYED THE FIRST MOVEMENT OF THE BAIT OF A VIOLIN CONCERTO AND AS I PLAYED I UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE WAS A PROFOUND CHANGE OCCURRING IN NATHANIEL'S EYES
RobertGupta_2010U-0019867-0020541.wav SHAPE WAS AS IF HE WAS IN THE GRIP OF SOME INVISIBLE FARM ACEUTICAL A CHEMICAL REACTION FOR WHICH MY PLAYING THE MUSIC
RobertGupta_2010U-0020541-0021229.wav WAS ITS CATTLEIST AND THE FANIELS MANIC RAGE
RobertGupta_2010U-0021229-0022001.wav WAS TRANSFORMED INTO UNDERSTANDING A QUIET CURIOSITY AND GRACE
RobertGupta_2010U-0022001-0023301.wav AND IN SHAPE MIRACLE HE LIFTED HIS OWN VIOLIN AND HE STARTED PLAYING BY EAR CERTAIN SNIPPETS OF VIOLIN CONJUREDOS WHICH HE THEN ASKED ME TO COMPLETE MENDELSSOHN TSCHAIKOVSKY SABBALIOS
RobertGupta_2010U-0023301-0024553.wav AND WE START A TALKING ABOUT MUSIC FROM BACH TO BEETHOVEN AND BRAHMS BROOKNER DO ALL THE BEES FROM BARTTOCK ALL THE WAY UP TO SPECCASALLANNA AND I UNDERSTOOD THAT HE NOT ONLY HAD AN ENCYCLOPEDIC KNOWLEDGE OF MUSIC
RobertGupta_2010U-0024553-0025550.wav BACK HE RELATED TO THIS MUSIC AT A PERSONAL LEVEL HE SPOKE ABOUT IT WITH A KIND OF PASSION AND UNDERSTANDING THAT I SHA WITH MY COLLEAGUES IN THE LOS ANGELES PHILLAMONIC
RobertGupta_2010U-0025550-0026143.wav AND THROUGH PLAIN MUSIC AND TALKING ABOUT MUSIC THIS MAN HAD TRANSFORMED
RobertGupta_2010U-0026143-0026945.wav FROM THE PARANOIT DISTURBED MAN THAT HAD JUST COME FROM WALKING THE STREETS OF DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES TO THE CHARMING
RobertGupta_2010U-0026945-0027836.wav ERUDITES BRILLIANT JULIA TRAINED MUSICIAN MUSIC IS MEDICINE
RobertGupta_2010U-0027836-0029180.wav MUSIC CHANGES US AND FOR NATHANIEL MUSIC IS SANITY BECAUSE MUSIC ALLOWS HIM TO TAKE HIS THOUGHTS AND DELUSIONS AND SHAPE SHAPE THEM THROUGH HIS IMAGINATION AND HIS CREATTIVITY INTO REALITY
RobertGupta_2010U-0029180-0029611.wav AND THAT IS IN ESCAPE FROM HIS TORMENTED STATE
RobertGupta_2010U-0029611-0030712.wav AND I UNDERSTOOD BACK THIS WAS THE VERY ESSENCE OF ART THIS WAS A VERY REASON WHY WE MADE MUSIC THAT WE TAKE SOMETHING THAT EXISTS WITHIN ALL OF US AT OUR VERY FUNDAMENTAL CORPS OUR EMOTIONS
RobertGupta_2010U-0030712-0031379.wav AND THROUGH OUR ARTISTIC LENS THROUGH OUR CRETIVITY WERE ABLE TO SHAPE THOSE EMOTIONS INTO REALITY
RobertGupta_2010U-0031379-0032294.wav SHAPE AND THE REALITY OF THAT EXPRESSION REACHES ALL OF US AND MOVES US INSPIRES AND UNITES US
RobertGupta_2010U-0032294-0032808.wav AND FOR NATHANIEL MUSIC BROUGHT HIM BACK INTO A FOLD OF FRIENDS
RobertGupta_2010U-0032808-0033863.wav THE REDEMPTIVE POWER OF MUSIC BROUGHT HIM BACK BACK INTO A FAMILY OF MUSICIANS THAT UNDERSTOOD HIM THAT RECOGNIZED HIS TALENTS AND RESPECTED HIM
RobertGupta_2010U-0033863-0035117.wav ROW AND I WILL ALWAYS MAKE MUSIC WITH NATHANIEL WHETHER WE ARE AT WALTZ AND HE CONCERT HALL OR ON SKID ROW BECAUSE HE REMINDS ME WHY I BECAME A MUSICIAN THANK YOU
RobertGupta_2010U-0035819-0036045.wav AZURE MASS
RobertGupta_2010U-0036123-0036220.wav NEVER GETS UP
RobertGupta_2010U-0038266-0038703.wav AND IN A PLACE SOMETHING THAT I SHAMELESSLY STOLE FROM CELLISTS SO PLEASED FORGIVE YOU
TomWujec_2010U-0001626-0004156.wav THREE YEARS AGO HERE A TED PETER SKILLMAN INTRODUCED A DESIGN CHALLENGE CALLED THE MARSHMALLOW CHALLENGE AND THE IDEA IS PRETTY SIMPLE TEAMS OF FOUR HAVE TO BUILD A TALLEST FREE STANDING STRUCTURE OUT OF TWENTY STICKS A SPAGHETTI ONE YARD OF TAPE ONE YARD OF STRING AND A MARSHMALLOW THE MARSHMALLOW HAS TO BE ON TOP AND THOUGH IT SEEMS REALLY SIMPLE IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY HARD BECAUSE IT FORCES PEOPLE TO COLLABORATE VERY QUICKLY IT'S ACTUALLY
TomWujec_2010U-0004156-0004920.wav AND OH I THOUGHT THIS WAS AN INTERESTING IDEA AND I INCORPORATED INTO A DESIGNED WORKSHOP AND IT WAS A HUGE SUCCESS AND SINCE THEN I'VE
TomWujec_2010U-0004920-0006666.wav CONDUCTED ABOUT SEVENTY DESIGN WORKSHOPS ALONG THE WORLD WITH STUDENTS AND DESIGNER IS IN ARCHITECTS EVEN THE CETIOS OF THE FORTUNE FIFTY AND THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THIS EXERCISE THAT REVEALS VERY DEEP LESSONS ABOUT THE NATURE OF COLLABORATION AND I'D LIKE TO SHARE SOME OF THEM WITH YOU SO
TomWujec_2010U-0006666-0008700.wav NORMALLY MOST PEOPLE BEGIN BY ORIENTING THEMSELVES TO THE TASK THEY TALK ABOUT IT THEY FIGURE AT WHAT IS GOING A LOOK LIKE THEY JOCKEY FOR POWER THEN THEY SPEND SOME TIME PLANNING ORGANIZING THEY SKETCH IN THEY LAY OUT SPECET A THEY'D SPEND THE MAJORITY OF THEIR TIME ASSEMBLING THE STICKS INTO EVER GROWING STRUCTURES AND THEN
TomWujec_2010U-0008700-0009587.wav FINALLY JUST AS THEY'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME SOME ONE TAKES OUT THE MARSHMALLOW AND THEN THEY GINGERLY PUT IT ON TOP AND THEY STAND BACK
TomWujec_2010U-0009587-0009748.wav AND TUDA
TomWujec_2010U-0009748-0010954.wav THEY OH ADMIRE THEIR WORK BUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENS MOST THE TIME IS THAT THAT A TODAD TURNS INTO AN OH CAUSE THE WEIGHT OF THE MARSHMALLOW CAUSES THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE TO BUCKLE AND TO COLLAPSE SO
TomWujec_2010U-0010954-0011682.wav THERE ARE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO'D HAVE A LOT MORE OH MOMENTS THAN OTHERS AND ALONG THE WORST ARE A RECENT GRADUATES OF BUSINESS SCHOOL
TomWujec_2010U-0011938-0013152.wav OH LIE THAT A SHEEP THEY A GET DISTRACTED THEY'VE DONE THEY PRODUCE REALLY LAMED STRUCTURES AND OF COURSE THERE'S TEAMS THAT HAVE A LOT MORE TODAS STRUCTURES AND AMONG THE BEST ARE RECENT GRADUATES OF KINDERGARTEN
TomWujec_2010U-0013299-0013334.wav
TomWujec_2010U-0013481-0014491.wav A PRETTY AMAZING AS PETER TELLS US I HAD NOT ONLY DID IT DO THEY PRODUCE THE TALLEST STRUCTURES BUT THE MOST INTERESTING STRUCTURES OF THEM ALL SO THE QUESTION HE WHEN ASK IS HELCOMBE
TomWujec_2010U-0014491-0015269.wav WHY OH WHAT IS IT ABOUT THEM AND PETER LIKES TO SAY THAT NONE OF THE SKIN UNDER THE KIDS SPEND ANY TIME TRYING TO BE SEA EEL SPAGHETTI INK
TomWujec_2010U-0015269-0016219.wav OH RIGHT THEY DON'T TIME IT SPEND TIME JOCKING FOR PART BUT THERE'S ANOTHER REASON IS WELL AND THE REASON IS THAT BUSINESS STUDENTS ARE TRAINED TO FIND THE SINGLE RIGHT PLAN
TomWujec_2010U-0016219-0016949.wav RIGHT AND THEN THEY EXECUTE ON IT AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS WHEN THEY PUT THE MARSHMALLOW ON A TOP THEY RUN OUT OF TIME AND WHAT HAPPENS IT'S A CRISIS
TomWujec_2010U-0017131-0017995.wav SOUND FAMILIAR RIGHT OH WHAT KINDER GARDENERS DO DIFFERENTLY IS THAT THEY START WITH A MARSHMALLOW AND THEY BUILD PROTOTYPE'S SUCCESSIVE PROTOTYPES
TomWujec_2010U-0017995-0018863.wav ALWAYS KEEPING THE MARSHMALLOW IN TOPS O THEY OF MULTIPLE TIMES ADD TO TO FIX IN A BUILT PROTOTYPES ALONG THE WAY SO AS ANIERS RECOGNISED THIS TYPE OF COLLABORATION
TomWujec_2010U-0018863-0019612.wav AS THE ESSENCE OF THE ADORATIVE PROCESS AND WITH EACH VERSION KIDS GET INSTANT FEED BACK ABOUT WHAT WORKS AND WHAT DOESN'T WORK
TomWujec_2010U-0019612-0020200.wav SO THE CAPACITY DA PLAY AND PROTOTYPE IS IS REALLY ESSENTIAL BUT LET'S LOOK AT HOW DIFFERENT TEAMS PERFORM
TomWujec_2010U-0020200-0021385.wav SO THE AVERAGE FOR MOST PEOPLE IS ALONG TWENTY INCHES BUSINESS SCHOOLS DIDN'T MOUNT A HALF OF THAT LAWYERS OH BETTER BUT NOT MUCH BETTER THAN THAT KINDERGARTENS BETTER THAN MOST ADULTS WHO DOES THE VERY BEST
TomWujec_2010U-0021385-0021767.wav ARCHITECTS AND ENGINEERS THANKFULLY AND
TomWujec_2010U-0022235-0023455.wav THIRTY NINE INCHES THE TALLEST STRUCTURE OH I'VE SEEN AND WHY IS IT BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND TRIANGLES AND SELF REINFORCING GEOMETRICAL PATTERNS OR THE KEY TO BUILDING SELF A REINFORCE AT THIS STABLE STRUCTURES
TomWujec_2010U-0023455-0024381.wav SO I SEE OHS LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN AVERAGE BUT HERE'S WHERE GETS INTERESTING IF YOU PUT IN A EXECUTIVE ADMIN ON THE TEAM THEY GET SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER
TomWujec_2010U-0024554-0024688.wav YOU KNOW
TomWujec_2010U-0024688-0026094.wav LOOK AROUND TO GO OUT THAT TEAMSKIN OIN HE JUST TELL BEFOREHAND AND WHY'S THAT BECAUSE THEY HAVE SPECIAL SKILLS OF FACILITATION THEY MANAGE THE PROCESSLY UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS AND ANY TEAM WHO MANAGES AND PAYS A CLOSE ATTENTION TO TO WORK
TomWujec_2010U-0026094-0027044.wav OH IT WILL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE TEAMS PERFORMERS SPECIALIZED SKILLS AND FACILITATION SKILLS AT THE COMBINATION LEADS TO TO TO STRONG SUCCESS
TomWujec_2010U-0027044-0027776.wav OH TEN TEAMS CERTIFICALLY PERFORMED YOU'LL GET MAYBE SIX OR SO THAT OF STANDING STRUCTURES IN A I I'D TRIED SOMETHING INTERESTING I THOUGHT LET'S
TomWujec_2010U-0027776-0028693.wav UP THE AN TEA ONCE SO I OFFERED A TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR PRIZE A SOFT WORD TO THE WINNING TEAM SO WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED TO THESE DESIGNED STUDENTS WHAT WAS THE RESULT
TomWujec_2010U-0028693-0029055.wav HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED
TomWujec_2010U-0029055-0031142.wav MAR ONE TEAM HAD A STANDING STRUCTURE NOT ONE HAD A IF ANYONE HAD BUILT SAY OH A ONE INSTRUCTOR LATER WOULDN'T SHAKEN ON THAT THE PRIZE SO ISN'T IT INTERESTING THAT HIGH STAKES A HAVE A STRONG IMPET WE DID THE EXERCISE AGAIN WITH THE SAME STUDENTS WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED THEN SO NOW THEY UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF PROTOTYPING
TomWujec_2010U-0031142-0032519.wav SO THE SAME TEAM WENT FROM BEING THE VERY WORST TO BEING ALONG THE VERY BEST THEY PRODUCED THE TALLEST STRUCTURES IN THE LEAST AMOUNT A TIME SO THERE'S A RE DEEP LESSONS FOR US ABOUT THE NATURE OF INCENTIVES AND SUCCESS
TomWujec_2010U-0032519-0033857.wav OH YOU MIGHT ASK WHY WOULD ANYONE ACTUALLY SPEND TIME RUNNING A MARSHMALLOW A CHALLENGE AND THE REASON IS I HELPED GREAT DIGITAL TOOLS AND PROCESSES TO HELP A TEAMS BUILD CARS AND VIDIO GAMES AND VISUAL EFFECTS AH
TomWujec_2010U-0033857-0034512.wav AND WHAT THE MARSHMALLOW CHALLENGE DADS AS IT HELPS AND IDENTIFY THE HIDDEN ASSUMPTIONS BECAUSE FRANKLY
TomWujec_2010U-0034512-0036927.wav EVERY PROJECT HAS ITS OWN MARSHMALLOW OHSNA THAT THE CHALLENGE PROVIDES A SHARE OF EXPERIENCE A COMMON LANGUAGE A COMMON SENSE TO BUILD THE RIGHT PROTOTYPE AND SO THIS IS THE VALUE OF THE EXPERIENCE OF THIS SO SIMPLE EXERCISE AND THOSE OF YOU ARE INTERESTED MAY ONE WHO GO TO MARSHMALLOW CHALLENGED OUR COMMENTS A BLOG THAT YOU CAN LOOK AT HOW TO BUILD A THE MARSHMALLOWS ARE STEPPED BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS ON THIS AD THERE AREARDSUE AD THERE ARE AUNTS A BLOG I'S A BLOGS A BLOG I'S A BLOG THERE ARE
TomWujec_2010U-0036927-0037543.wav CRAZY EXAMPLES FROM ALONG THE WORLD OF HOW PEOPLE TWEAK AND ADJUST THE SYSTEM ITS WORLD RECORDS THAT ARE ON THIS AS WELL
TomWujec_2010U-0037543-0040217.wav OH THE FUNDAMENTAL LESSON I BELIEVE IS THAT DESIGN TRULY IS A CONTACT SPORT A IT DEMANDS THAT WE BRING ALL OF OUR SENSES TO THE TASK AND THAT WE APPLY THE VERY BEST OF OUR THINKING A FEELING AND OUR DOING TO THE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE A AT HAND AND SOMETIMES A LITTLE PROTOTYPE OF THIS EXPERIENCE IS ALL THAT IT TAKES TO TURN US FROM A AND OH OHO MOMENT TO A TEDAM A MOMENT AND THAT CAN MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE THANK YOU MUCH
