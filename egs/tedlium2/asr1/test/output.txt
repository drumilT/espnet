AimeeMullins_2009P-0008632-0009505.wav I WAS READING THIS LIST OUT LOUD TO A FRIEND AND AT FIRST WAS LAUGHING IT WAS SO LUDICROUS BUT I JUST GOT AND PASSED MANGLED
AimeeMullins_2009P-0009505-0010405.wav WHEN MY VOICE BROKE AND I HAD TO STOP AND COLLECT MYSELF FROM THE EMOTIONAL SHOCK
AimeeMullins_2009P-0010430-0010973.wav AH AN IMPACT OF THE ASSAULT FROM THESE WORDS UNLEASHED
AimeeMullins_2009P-0010973-0012123.wav AND ON I'M AT COURSE AS IS MY RAGGEDY OLD PISARRA SOME THINKING THIS MUST BE AN ANCIENT PRINT DATE RIGHT BUT IN FACT A PRINTATE WAS THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY
AimeeMullins_2009P-0012123-0013544.wav WHEN I WOULD HAVE BEEN A STARTING PRIMARY SCHOOL IN FORMING AN UNDERSTANDING OF MYSELF OUTSIDE THE FAMILY UNIT AND AS RELATED TO THE OTHER KIDS IN THE WORLD AROUND ME AND NEEDLESS TO SAY THANK GOD I WASN'T USING AT THE SARACE BACK THEN
AimeeMullins_2009P-0013544-0014951.wav I MEAN FROM THIS ENTRY IT WOULD SEEM THAT I WAS BORN INTO A WORLD THAT PERCEIVED SOME ONE LIKE ME TO HAVE NOTHING POSITIVE WHATSOEVER GOING FOR THEM WHEN IN FACTS A DAY
AimeeMullins_2009P-0014951-0015866.wav I'M CELEBRATED FOR AH THE OPPORTUNITIES AND ADVENTURES MY LIFE HAVE PROCURED SO M I IMMEDIATELY
AimeeMullins_2009P-0015866-0016844.wav WENT TO LOOK UP A TWO THOUSAND NINE ON LINE ADDITION EXPECTING TO FIND A REVISION WORTH NOTING HERE'S THE UPBATED VERSION OF THIS ENTRY
AimeeMullins_2009P-0016844-0018066.wav FORTUNATELY IT'S NOT MUCH BETTER I FIND THEE THE LAST TWO WORDS UNDER NEAR ANTONYMS PARTICULARLY UNSETTLING WHOLE AND WHOLESOME
AimeeMullins_2009P-0018227-0018484.wav SO IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE WORDS
AimeeMullins_2009P-0018484-0019618.wav IT'S WHAT WE BELIEVE ABOUT PEOPLE WHEN WE NAME THEM WITH THESE WORDS ABOUT THE VALUES BEHIND THE WORDS AND HOW WE CONSTRUCT THOSE VALUES OUR LANGUAGE AFFECTS OUR THINKING
AimeeMullins_2009P-0019618-0020658.wav AND HOW WE VIEW THE WORLD AND HOW WE VIEW OTHER PEOPLE IN FACT MANY ANCIENT SOCIETIES INCLUDING THE GREEKS IN THE ROMANS BELIEVED THAT TO UTTER A CURSE
AimeeMullins_2009P-0020658-0021408.wav VERBALLY WAS SO POWERFUL BECAUSE TO SAY THE THING OUT LOUD BROUGHT IT INTO EXISTENCE
AimeeMullins_2009P-0021558-0022537.wav SO WHAT REALITY DO WE WANT TO CALL INTO EXISTENCE A PERSON WHO IS LIMITED OR A PERSON WHO IS EMPOWERED
AimeeMullins_2009P-0022596-0023219.wav BY CASUALLY DOING SOMETHING AS SYMBOL IS NAMING A PERSON A CHILD
AimeeMullins_2009P-0023219-0024260.wav WE MIGHT BE PUTTING LIDS AND CASTING SHADOWS ON THEIR POWER WOULDN'T WE WANT TO OPEN DOORS FOR THEM INSTEAD
AimeeMullins_2009P-0024260-0025318.wav ONCE A PERSON WHO OPENED DOORS FOR ME WAS MY CHILDHOOD DOCTOR AT THE A I DUPONT INSTITUTE IN WILMINGTON DELAWARE HIS NAME IS DOCTOR PITS A TILO
AimeeMullins_2009P-0025318-0026172.wav A M ITALIAN AMERICAN WHOSE NAME APPARENTLY WAS TOO DIFFICULT FOR MOST AMERICANS TO PRONOUNCE SO HE WENT BY DOCTOR P AND DOCTOR P
AimeeMullins_2009P-0026172-0026922.wav ALWAYS WERE REALLY COLORFUL BOAT TIES AND M HAD THE VERY PERFECT DISPOSITION TO WORK WITH CHILDREN
AimeeMullins_2009P-0026922-0027863.wav I LOVED ALMOST EVERYTHING ABOUT MY TIME SPENT AT THIS HOSPITAL WISHED THE EXCEPTION OF MY PHYSICAL FAIR RECESSIONS
AimeeMullins_2009P-0027863-0028948.wav I HAD TO DO WHAT SEEMED LIKE INNUMERABLE REPETITIONS OF EXERCISES WITH THESE THICK ELASTIC BANDS AT DIFFERENT COLORS YOU KNOW
AimeeMullins_2009P-0028948-0029689.wav TO HELP BUILD UP MY LEG MUSCLES AND I HATED THESE BANDS MORE THAN ANYTHING I HATED THEM HAD NAMED FOR THEM I HATED THEM AND
AimeeMullins_2009P-0029689-0030481.wav NO I WAS ALREADY BARGAINING AT THE FIVE YEAR OLD CHILD WITH DOCTOR P TO TRY TO GET OUT OF DOING THESE EXERCISES UNSUCCESSFULLY OF COURSE
AimeeMullins_2009P-0030481-0031277.wav AND ONE DAY HE CAME IN TO MY SESSION M EXHAUSTIVE AND UNFORGIVING
AimeeMullins_2009P-0031277-0032020.wav THESE SESSIONS AND HE SAID TO ME WELL AMY YOU ARE SUCH A STRONG POWERFUL LITTLE GIRL
AimeeMullins_2009P-0032020-0032956.wav I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO BREAK ONE OF THOSE BANDS WHEN YOU DO BREAK IN I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A HUNDRED BOX NOW COURSE THIS WAS A SIMPLE EMPLOYE
AimeeMullins_2009P-0032956-0033802.wav ON DOCTOR PEAS'S PARTS WHO'D GET ME TO DO THE EXERCISES I DIDN'T WANT TO DO BEFORE THE PROSPECT OF BEING THE RICHEST FIVE YEAR OLD IN THE SECOND FLOOR WARD
AimeeMullins_2009P-0033802-0034947.wav BUT WHAT HE EFFECTIVELY DID FOR ME WAS RE SHAPE AN AWFUL DAILY OCCURRENCE INTO A NEW AND PROMISING EXPERIENCE FOR ME
AimeeMullins_2009P-0034947-0035686.wav AND I HAVE TO WONDER TO DAY TO WHAT EXTENT HIS VISION AND HIS DECLARATION OF ME
AimeeMullins_2009P-0035686-0036783.wav AS A STRONG AND POWERFUL LITTLE GIRL SHAPE MY OWN VIEW OF MYSELF AS AN INHERENTLY STRONG POWERFUL AND ATHLETIC PERSON WELL INTO THE FUTURE
AimeeMullins_2009P-0036783-0037485.wav THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW ADULTS AND POSITIONS OF POWER CAN IGNITE THE POWER OF A CHILD
AimeeMullins_2009P-0037485-0038551.wav BUT IN THE PREVIOUS INSTANCES OF THOSE THE SARA SENTRY YET OUR LANGUAGE ISN'T ALLOWING US TO EVOLVE INTO THE REALITY THAT WE WOULD ALL WANT
AimeeMullins_2009P-0038551-0039101.wav NOW THE POSSIBILITY OF AN INDIVIDUAL TO SEE THEMSELVES AS CAPABLE
AimeeMullins_2009P-0039227-0040235.wav OUR LANGUAGE HASN'T CAUGHT UP WITH THE CHANGES IN OUR SOCIETY MANY OF WHICH HAVE BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT BY TECHNOLOGY CERTAINLY FROM A MEDICAL STANDPOINT
AimeeMullins_2009P-0040235-0041940.wav MY LEGS AH YOU KNOW LAZAR SURGERY FOR A VISION IMPAIRMENT A TITANIUM KNEES AND HIP REPLACEMENTS FOR AGING BODIES THAT ARE ALLOWING PEOPLE TO MORE FULLY ENGAGED WITH THEIR ABILITIES AND MOVE BEYOND THE LIMITS THAT NATURE IS IMPOSED ON THEM
AimeeMullins_2009P-0041940-0043192.wav NOT TO MENTION SOCIAL NET WORKING PLATFORMS ALLOWS PEOPLE TO SELF IDENTIFY TO CLAIM THEIR OWN DESCRIPTIONS OF THEMSELVES SO THEY CAN GO A LINE WITH GLOBEAL GROUPS OF THEIR OWN CHOOSING
AimeeMullins_2009P-0043323-0044675.wav SO PERHAPS ACKNOWLEDGES REVEALING MORE CLEARLY TO US NOW WHAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A TRUTH THAT EVERY ONE HAS SOMETHING RARE AND POWERFUL TO OFFER OUR SOCIETY
AimeeMullins_2009P-0044776-0045808.wav AND THAT THE HUMAN ABILITY TO ADAPT IS OUR GREATEST ASSET A HUMAN ABILITY TO ADAPT AN INTERESTING THING BECAUSE PEOPLE
AimeeMullins_2009P-0045808-0046227.wav HAVE CONTINUALLY WANTED TO TALK TO ME ABOUT OVERCOMING ADVERSITY
AimeeMullins_2009P-0046227-0047443.wav AN OMENED MAKE AN ADMISSION THIS PHRASE NEVER SAT RIGHT WITH ME AND I ALWAYS FELT UNEASY TRYING TO ANSWER PEOPLE'S QUESTIONS ABOUT IT AND I THINK I'M STARTING TO FIGURE OUT WHY
AimeeMullins_2009P-0047443-0048316.wav IMPLICIT IN THIS PHRASE OF OVERCOMING ADVERSITY IS THE IDEA THAT SUCCESS OR HAPPINESS
AimeeMullins_2009P-0048316-0049171.wav IS ABOUT EMERGING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF A CHALLENGING EXPERIENCE UNSCATHED OR UNMARKED BY THE EXPERIENCE
AimeeMullins_2009P-0049171-0050267.wav AS IF MY SUCCESSES IN LIFE HAD COME ABOUT FROM AN ABILITY TO SIDE STEP OR CIRCUMNAVIGATE THE PRESUME PIT BALLS OF A LIFE WITH PROPHETICS OR WHAT OTHER PEOPLE PERCEIVE IS MY DISABILITY
AimeeMullins_2009P-0050267-0051512.wav BUT IN FACT WE ARE CHANGED WE ARE MARKED OF COURSE BY A CHALLENGE WHETHER PHYSICALLY EMOTIONALLY OR BOTH AN OMINOUS SUGGEST THAT THIS IS A GOOD THING
AimeeMullins_2009P-0051512-0052435.wav ADVERSITY ISN'T AN OBSTACLE THAT WE NEED TO GET AROUND IN ORDER TO RESUME LIVING OUR LIFE IT'S PART OF OUR LIFE
AimeeMullins_2009P-0052435-0053316.wav AND I TEND TO THINK OF IT LIKE MY SHADOW SOMETIMES I SEE A LOT OF IT SOMETIMES THERE'S VERY LITTLE BUT IT'S ALWAYS WITH ME
AimeeMullins_2009P-0053316-0054135.wav AS CERTAINLY I'M NOT TRYING TO DIMINISH THE IMPACT THE WEIGHT OF A PERSON'S STRUGGLE THERE IS
AimeeMullins_2009P-0054135-0055215.wav ADVERSITY AND CHALLENGE IN LIFE AND IS ALL VERY REAL AND RELATIVE TO EVERY SINGLE PERSON BUT THE QUESTION ISN'T WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE GOING TO MEET ADVERSITY BUT HOW YOU'RE GOING TO MEET IT
AimeeMullins_2009P-0055215-0056279.wav SO OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS NOT SIMPLY SHIELDING THOSE WE CARE FOR FROM ADVERSITY BUT PREPARING THEM TO MEET IT WELL
AimeeMullins_2009P-0056279-0057375.wav AND WE DO IT TO SERVICE TO OUR KIDS WHEN WE MAKE THEM FEEL THAT THEY ARE NOT EQUIPPED TO ADAPT
AimeeMullins_2009P-0057375-0058754.wav THERE'S AN IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE AND DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE OBJECTIVE MEDICAL FACT OF MY BEING AN AMPUTY AND THE SUBJECTIVE SOCIETYAL OPINION OF WHETHER OR NOT I'M DISABLED
AimeeMullins_2009P-0058754-0059916.wav AND TRUTHFULLY THE ONLY REAL AND CONSISTENT DISABILITY I'VE HAD TO CONFRONT IS THE WORLD EVER THINKING THAT I COULD BE DESCRIBED BY THOSE DEFINITIONS
AimeeMullins_2009P-0059916-0060664.wav IN OUR DESIRE TO PROTECT THOSE WE CARE ABOUT BY GIVING THEM THE COLD HARD TRUTH ABOUT THEIR MEDICAL PROGNOSIS
AimeeMullins_2009P-0060664-0061624.wav OR INDEED A PROGNNOSIS ON THE EXPECTED QUALITY OF THEIR LIFE WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T PUT THE FIRST BRICK IN A WALL THAT WILL ACTUALLY
AimeeMullins_2009P-0061624-0062591.wav DISABLE SOMEONE PERHAPS THE EXISTING MODEL OF ONLY LOOKING AT WHAT IS BROKEN IN YOU AND HOW DO WE FIX IT
AimeeMullins_2009P-0062591-0063563.wav SERVES TO BE MORE DISABLING TO THE INDIVIDUAL THAN THE PATHOLOGY ITSELF BY NOT TREATING THE WHOLENESS OF A PERSON
AimeeMullins_2009P-0063563-0064440.wav BY NOT ACKNOWLEDGING THEIR POTENCY WE ARE CREATING ANOTHER ILL ON TOP OF WHATEVER NATURAL STRUGGLE THEY MIGHT HAVE
AimeeMullins_2009P-0064440-0065937.wav WE ARE EFFECTIVELY GRATING SOMEONE'S WORTH TO OUR COMMUNITY SO WE NEED TO SEE THROUGH THE PATHOLOGY AND INTO THE RANGE OF HUMAN CAPABILITY
AimeeMullins_2009P-0065937-0066929.wav AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THERE IS A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THOSE PERCEIVED DEFICIENCIES AND OUR GREATEST CREATIVE ABILITY
AimeeMullins_2009P-0066929-0068108.wav SO IT'S NOT ABOUT DEVOURING OR NEGATING THESE MORE TRYING TIMES AS SOMETHING WE WANT TO AVOID OR SWEEP UNDER THE RUG BUT INSTEAD TO FIND THOSE OPPORTUNITIES
AimeeMullins_2009P-0068108-0069370.wav RACKED IN THE ADVERSITY SO MAYBE THE IDEA I WANT TO PUT OUT THERE IS NOT SO MUCH OVERCOMING ADVERSITY AS IT IS OPENING OURSELVES UP TO IT
AimeeMullins_2009P-0069586-0070401.wav EMBRACING IT GRAPPLING WITH IT THESE RUSTLING TERM MAY BE EVEN DANCING WITH IT
AimeeMullins_2009P-0070569-0071687.wav AND PERHAPS IF WE SEE ADVERSITY AS NATURAL CONSISTENT AND USEFUL WERE LESS BURDENED BY THE PRESENCE OF IT
AimeeMullins_2009P-0071687-0072903.wav THIS YEAR WE CELEBRATED THE TWO HUNDRED BIRTHDAY OF CHARLES DARWIN AND IT WAS A HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO WHEN WRITING ABOUT EVOLUTION THE DARWIN ILLUSTRATED I THINK A TRUTH ABOUT THE HUMAN CHARACTER
AimeeMullins_2009P-0072903-0074110.wav TO PARAPHRASE IT'S NOT THE STRONGEST OF THE SPECIES THAT SURVIVES NOR IS IT THE MOST INTELLIGENT THAT SURVIVES IT IS THE ONE THAT IS MOST ADAPTABLE TO CHANGE
AimeeMullins_2009P-0074110-0075391.wav CONFLICT IS THE GENESIS OF CREATION FROM DARWIN'S WORK AMONG FEATHERS WE CAN RECOGNIZE THAT THE HUMAN ABILITY TO SURVIVE AND FLOURISH
AimeeMullins_2009P-0075391-0076587.wav IS DRIVEN BY THE THE STRUGGLE OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT THROUGH CONFLICT INTO TRANSFORMATION SO AGAIN TRANSFORMATION ADAPTATION IS OUR GREATEST
AimeeMullins_2009P-0076587-0077977.wav HUMAN SKILL AND PERHAPS YOU KNOW UNTIL WE'RE TESTED WE DON'T KNOW WE'RE MADE OF MAYBE THAT OF ADVERSITY GIVES US A SENSE OF SELF A SENSE OF OUR OWN POWER
AimeeMullins_2009P-0077977-0079016.wav SO WE CAN GIVE OURSELVES A GIFT WE CAN RE IMAGINE ADVERSITY AS SOMETHING MORE THAN JUST TOUGH TIMES
AimeeMullins_2009P-0079016-0079872.wav MAYBE WE CAN SEE IT IS CHANGE ADVERSITY IS JUST CHANGED THAT WE HAVEN'T ADAPTED OURSELVES TOO YET
AimeeMullins_2009P-0079872-0080438.wav I THINK THE GREATEST ADVERSITY THAT WE'VE CREATED FOR OURSELVES IS THIS IDEA OF NORMALCY
AimeeMullins_2009P-0080438-0081166.wav WHO'S NORMAL THERE'S NO NORMAL THERE'S COMMON THERE'S TYPICAL
AimeeMullins_2009P-0081166-0082197.wav THERE'S NO NORMAL AND WOULD YOU WANT TO MEET THAT POOR BAISH PERSON IF THEY EXISTED I'LL THINK SO IF WE CAN CHANGE THIS PARADISE FROM ONE OF
AimeeMullins_2009P-0082197-0083509.wav ACHIEVING NORMALCY TO ONE OF POSSIBILITY OR POTENCY DO EVEN ALL BUT MORE DANGEROUS WE CAN RELEASE THE POWER OF SO MANY MORE CHILDREN AND INVITE THEM TO ENGAGE
AimeeMullins_2009P-0083509-0084925.wav THEY ARE RARE AND VALUABLE ABILITIES WITH THE COMMUNITY ANTHROPOLOGIST TELL US THAT THE ONE THING WE AS HUMANS HAVE ALWAYS REQUIRED OF OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS IS TO BE OF USE TO BE ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE
AimeeMullins_2009P-0084925-0085968.wav THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT NIANDER SALTS SIXTY THOUSAND YEARS AGO CARRIED THEIR ELDERLY AND THOSE WITH SERIOUS PHYSICAL INJURY
AimeeMullins_2009P-0085968-0086886.wav AND PERHAPS IT'S BECAUSE THE LIFE EXPERIENCE OF SURVIVAL OF THESE PEOPLE PROVED A VALUE TO THE COMMUNITY
AimeeMullins_2009P-0086886-0087684.wav THEY DIDN'T VIEW THESE PEOPLE AS BROKEN AND USELESS THEY WERE SEEN AS RARE AND VALUABLE
AimeeMullins_2009P-0087684-0088306.wav FEW YEARS AGO I WAS IN A FOOD MARKET IN THE TOWN WHERE I GREW UP IN THAT RED ZONE AND NORTH EASTERN PENNSYLVANIA
AimeeMullins_2009P-0088306-0089205.wav AND I WAS STANDING OVER A BUSHEL OF TOMATOES IT WAS SUMMER TIME I HAD SHORTS ON I HEARD THIS GUY HIS VOICE BEHIND ME SAY WELL IF IT ISN'T AIMED IN MULLINS
AimeeMullins_2009P-0089205-0089905.wav I TURN AROUND AND IS HIS OLDER MAN I HAVE NO IDEA WHO IS AND I SAID AH I'M SORRY SIR I DON'T
AimeeMullins_2009P-0089905-0090720.wav HOW WE MET I DON'T REMEMBER MEETING YOU HE SAID WHAT YOU WOULDN'T REMEMBER MEETING ME WHEN WHEN WE MET I WAS DELIVERING YOU FROM YOUR MOTHER'S WOMB
AimeeMullins_2009P-0090720-0091363.wav OH THAT GUY IF NOT MUCH AND OF COURSE ACTUALLY
AimeeMullins_2009P-0091363-0092262.wav IT DID CLICK THIS MAN WAS DOCTOR KEEN A MAN THAT I HAD ONLY KNOWN ABOUT TO MY MOTHER'S STORIES OF THAT DAY BECAUSE OF COURSE
AimeeMullins_2009P-0092262-0093565.wav TYPICAL FASHION I ARRIVED LATE FOR MY BIRTHDAY BY TWO WEEKS AND SO MY MOTHER'S PRENATAL PHYSICIAN HAD GONE IN OCCASION SO THE MAN WHO DELIVERED ME WAS A COMPLETE STRANGER TO MY PARENTS
AimeeMullins_2009P-0093565-0094478.wav AND BECAUSE I WAS WARM ABOUT THE SINGULAR BONES AND HAD FEET TURNED IN AND A FEW TOES IN THIS FOOT IN A FUTOS IN THAT HE HAD TO BE THE BEARER THE STRANGER
AimeeMullins_2009P-0094478-0095339.wav HAD TO BE THE BEARER OF BAD NEWS HE SAID TO ME I HAD TO GIVE THIS PROGNOSIS TO YOUR PARENTS THAT YOU WOULD NEVER WALK
AimeeMullins_2009P-0095339-0096121.wav AND YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE THE KIND OF MOBILITY THAT OTHER KISS HAVE OR ANY KIND OF LIFE OF INDEPENDENCE AND YOU'VE BEEN MAKING A LIAR OUT OF ME EVER SINCE
AimeeMullins_2009P-0096939-0097577.wav THE EXTRAORDINARY THING IS THAT HE SAID HE HAD SAVED NEWSPAPER CLIPPING THROUGHOUT MY WHOLE CHILDHOOD
AimeeMullins_2009P-0097577-0098593.wav WHETHER WINNING A SECOND GREAT SPELLING BE MARCHING WITH THE GIRL SCOUTS AND OUT OF THE HOLLOWING PARADE WINNING MY COLLEGE SCHOLARSHIP OR ANY OF MY SPORTS VICTORIES
AimeeMullins_2009P-0098593-0099417.wav AND HE WAS USING IT IN INTEGRATING ANITUDE TEACHING A RESIDENCE STUDENTS MET STUDENTS FROM HONNEMEN
AimeeMullins_2009P-0099417-0100299.wav MEDICAL SCHOOL AND HERSY MEDICAL SCHOOL AND HE CALLED THIS PART OF THE COURSE THE EX FACTOR THERE WAS THE POTENTIAL OF THE HUMAN WILL
AimeeMullins_2009P-0100299-0101128.wav NO PROGNOSIS CAN ACCOUNT FOR HOW POWERFUL THIS COULD BE IN THAT AS A DETERMINATE IN THE QUALITY OF SOME ONE'S LIFE
AimeeMullins_2009P-0101128-0102204.wav AND DOCTOR KING WENT ON TO TELL ME THAT HE SAID IN MY EXPERIENCE UNLESS REPEATEDLY TOLD OTHERWISE
AimeeMullins_2009P-0102204-0103166.wav AND EVEN IF GIVEN A MODOM MODICUM OF SUPPORT IF LEFT TO THEIR OWN DEVICES A CHILD WILL ACHIEVE
AimeeMullins_2009P-0103166-0104197.wav THE DOCTOR KEENE MADE THAT SHIFT AND THINKING HE UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MEDICAL CONDITION AND WHAT SOME ONE MIGHT DO WITH IT
AimeeMullins_2009P-0104197-0105578.wav THERE'S BEEN A SHIFT IN MY THINKING OVERTIME AND THAT IF YOU'D ASKED ME AT FIFTEEN YEARS OLD IF I WOULD HAVE TRADED PROPHETICS FOR FLESH AND BONE LEGS I WOULDN'T HAVE HESITATED FOR A SECOND
AimeeMullins_2009P-0105578-0106539.wav I ASPIRED TO THAT KIND OF NORMAL SEA BACK THEN WOULD YOU ASK ME TO DAY I'M NOT SO SURE
AimeeMullins_2009P-0106539-0107571.wav AND IT'S BECAUSE OF THE EXPERIENCES I'VE HAD WITH THEM NOT IN SPITE OF THE EXPERIENCES I'VE HAD WITH THEM
AimeeMullins_2009P-0107571-0109070.wav AND PERHAPS THIS SHIFT IN ME HAS HAPPENED BECAUSE I'VE BEEN EXPOSED TO MORE PEOPLE WHO HAVE OPENED DOORS FOR ME THAN THOSE WHO HAVE PUT LIDS AND CAST SHADOWS ON ME
AimeeMullins_2009P-0109070-0110170.wav TO ALL YOU REALLY NEED IS ONE PERSON TO SHOW YOU THE EPIPHANY OF YOUR OWN POWER AND YOU'RE OFF IF YOU CAN HAND SOMEBODY THE KEY
AimeeMullins_2009P-0110170-0111240.wav TO THEIR OWN POWER THE HUMAN SPIRIT IS SO RECEPTIVE IF YOU CAN DO THAT AND OPEN A DOOR FOR SOME ONE AT A CRUCIAL MOMENT YOU ARE EDUCATING THEM IN THE BEST SENSE
AimeeMullins_2009P-0111240-0112174.wav YOUR TEACHING THEM TO OPEN DOORS FOR THEMSELVES IN FACT THE EXACT MEANING OF THE WORD EDUCATE
AimeeMullins_2009P-0112174-0113360.wav COMES FROM THE ROOT WORD ADUCE IT MEANS TO BRING FORTH WHAT IS WITHIN TO BRING OUT POTENTIAL SO AGAIN WHICH POTENTIAL DO WE WANT TO BRING OUT
AimeeMullins_2009P-0113542-0114566.wav THERE WAS A CASE THAT HE DONE IN NINETEEN SIXTY'S BRITAIN WHEN THEY WERE MOVING FROM COMPREY A GRAMMAR SCHOOLS TO COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOLS THAT CALLED THE STREAMING TRIALS WE CALL IT TRACKING
AimeeMullins_2009P-0114566-0115107.wav HERE IN THE STATES ITS SEPARATING STUDENTS FROM A B C D SO ON
AimeeMullins_2009P-0115107-0116565.wav AND NEAR THE AIS STUDENTS GET THE TOPER QUICKULEM THE BEST TEACHERS ET CETERA WHAT THEY TOOK OVER A THREE MONTH PERIOD D LEVEL STUDENTS GAVE THE MAZE TOLD THEM THEY WERE AS TOLD THEM THEY WERE BRIGHT AND AT THE END OF THIS THREE MONTH PERIOD
AimeeMullins_2009P-0116565-0117492.wav THEY WERE PERFORMING AT A LEVEL AND OF COURSE THE HARP RAKING FLIPSIDE OF THE STUDY IS THAT THEY TOOK THE A STUDENTS
AimeeMullins_2009P-0117492-0118408.wav AND TOLD HIM THEY WERE DEEDS AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED AT THE END OF THAT THREE MONTHS PERIOD THOSE WHO WERE STILL AROUND IN SCHOOL BESIDES THE DROP PEOPLE HAD DROPPED OUT
AimeeMullins_2009P-0118639-0119483.wav MISSUS THE CRUCIAL PART OF THIS CASE STUDY WAS THAT THE TEACHERS WERE DUPED TO
AimeeMullins_2009P-0119483-0120361.wav THE TEACHERS DIDN'T KNOW A SWITCH HAD BEEN MADE THEY WERE SIMPLY TOLD THESE ARE THE ATONS THESE ARE THE TEA STUDENTS AND THAT'S HOW THEY WENT ABOUT TEACHING THEM
AimeeMullins_2009P-0120361-0120998.wav AND TREATING THEM THOUGH I THINK
AimeeMullins_2009P-0120998-0121273.wav AT THE ONLY TRUE DISABILITY
AimeeMullins_2009P-0121273-0122382.wav IS A CRUSHED SPIRIT A SPIRIT THAT'S BEEN CRUSHED DOESN'T HAVE HOPE IT DOESN'T SEE BEAUTY
AimeeMullins_2009P-0122382-0123096.wav IT NO LONGER HAS OUR NATURAL CHILDLIKE CURIOSITY AND OUR INNATE ABILITY TO IMAGINE
AimeeMullins_2009P-0123285-0124111.wav IF INSTEAD WE CAN BOLSTER A HUMAN SPIRIT TO KEEP HOPE TO SEE BEAUTY IN THEMSELVES AND OTHERS
AimeeMullins_2009P-0124111-0124794.wav TO BE CURIOUS AND IMAGINATIVE THEN WE ARE TRULY USING OUR POWER WELL
AimeeMullins_2009P-0124794-0125680.wav WHEN A SPIRIT HAS THOSE QUALITIES WE ARE ABLE TO CREATE NEW REALITIES AND NEW WAYS OF BEING
AimeeMullins_2009P-0125680-0126334.wav I'D LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH A POEM BY A FOURTEENTH CENTURY PERSIAN POET NAMED HALFUS
AimeeMullins_2009P-0126334-0127291.wav AND MY FRIEND JACAM WAS TOLD ME ABOUT AND A POEM IS CALLED THE GOD WHO ONLY KNOWS FOUR WORDS EVERY CHILD
AimeeMullins_2009P-0127291-0128332.wav HAS KNOWN GOD NOT THE GOD OF NAMES NOT THE GOD OF DONTS BUT THE GOD WHO ONLY KNOWS FOUR WORDS
AimeeMullins_2009P-0128332-0129658.wav AND KEEPS REPEATING THEM SAYING COME DANCE WITH ME COME DANCE WITH ME COME THANK YOU
BillGates_2010-0001586-0001998.wav I DIDN'T TALK TO DAY ABOUT ENERGY AND CLIMATE
BillGates_2010-0001998-0003489.wav AND THAT MIGHT SEEM A BIT SURPRISING BECAUSE MYFUL TIME WORK AT THE FOUNDATION IS MOSTLY ABOUT VAXINGS AND SEEDS ABOUT THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO INVENT AND DELIVER TO HELP THE POOREST TU BILLION LIVE BETTER LIVES
BillGates_2010-0003489-0004472.wav BUT ENERGY AND CLIMATE ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO THESE PEOPLE IN FACT MORE IMPORTANT THAN TO ANYONE ELSE ON THE PLANET
BillGates_2010-0004472-0005330.wav THE CLIMATE GETTING WORSE MEANS THAT MANY YEARS THEIR CROPS WON'T GROW THEY'LL BE TOO MUCH RAIN NOT ENOUGH RAIN
BillGates_2010-0005372-0006727.wav THINGS WILL CHANGE AND WAYS THAT THEIR FRAGILE ENVIRONMENT SIMPLY CAN'T SUPPORT AND THAT LEADS TO STARVATION LEADS TO UNCERTAINTY IT LEADS ON REST ALSO THAT THE CLIMATE CHANGES WILL BE TERRIBLE FOR THEM
BillGates_2010-0006727-0008183.wav ALSO THE PRICE OF ENERGY IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THEM IN FACT IF YOU COULD PICK JUST ONE THING TO LOWER THE PRICE OF TO REDUCE POVERTY BY FAR YOU WOULD PICK ENERGY NOW THE PRICE OF ENERGY HAS COME DOWN OVERTIME
BillGates_2010-0008183-0009134.wav I REALLY A ADVANCE CIVILISATION OZ BASED ON ADVANCES IN IN ENERGY THE COLD REVOLUTION JEWELLED
BillGates_2010-0009134-0010503.wav THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION AND EVEN IN THE NINETEEN HUNDREDS WE'VE SEEN A VERY RAPID DECLINE IN THE PRICE OF LIKE CHRISTIE ON THAT'S WHY WE HAVE REFRIGERATOR'S AIR CONDITIONING WE CAN MAKE A MODERN MATERIALS AND DO SO MANY THINGS
BillGates_2010-0010503-0011167.wav AND SO WERE IN IT A WONDERFUL SITUATION WITH A ELECTRICITY IN THE RICH WORLD
BillGates_2010-0011223-0012163.wav BUT AS WE MAKE IT CHEAPER AND LET'S SAY LET'S GO FOR MAKING IT DOD TWICE AS CHEAP WE NEED TO MEAN A NEW CONSTRAINT
BillGates_2010-0012163-0012879.wav AND THAT CONSTRAINT HAS TO DO WITH SEAL TOO ZEAL TOO IS WARMING THE PLANET
BillGates_2010-0012879-0013841.wav AND THE EQUATION ONSEO TOO IS ACTUALLY A VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD ONE IF YOU SUM UP THE SEAL TOO THAT GETS OMITTED
BillGates_2010-0013841-0014663.wav THAT LEADS TO A TEMPERATURE INCREASE AND THAT TEMPERATURE INCREASE LEADS TO SOME VERY NEGATIVE EFFECTS THE EFFECTS ON THE WEATHER
BillGates_2010-0014663-0015625.wav OF PERHAPS WORSE THE INDIRECT EFFECTS IN THAT OF THE NATURAL LEGAL SYSTEMS CANT ADJUST TO THESE RAPID CHANGES AND SO YOU GET EGO SYSTEM COLLAPSES
BillGates_2010-0015625-0016181.wav NOW THE EXACT AMOUNT OF HOW YOU MAP FROM A CERTAIN INCREASE IN OF SEAL TOO
BillGates_2010-0016181-0017345.wav TO WHAT TEMPERATURE WILL BE IN WHERE THE POSITIVE THEBECKS ARE THERE'S SOME UNCERTAINTY THERE BUT NOT VERY MUCH AND THERE'S CERTAINLY UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW BAD THOSE EFFECTS WILL BE BUT THEY WILL BE EXTREMELY BAD
BillGates_2010-0017345-0018588.wav I ASK THE TOP TIME TO SEND US SEVERAL TIMES DO WE REALLY HAVE TO GET DOWN TO NEAR ZERO CAN'T WE JUST YOU'LL CUT IT HALF FOR A QUARTER AND THE ANSWER IS THAT UNTIL WE GET NEAR TO ZERO
BillGates_2010-0018588-0020192.wav THE TEMPERATURE WILL CONTINUE TO RISE AND SO THAT'S THAT'S A BIG CHALLENGE IT'S VERY DIFFERENT THEN SAYING IN A WORD TWELVE FOOT HIGH TROT TRYING TO GET UNDER A TEN FOOT BRIDGE AND WE CAN DO SORT OF SQUEEZE UNDER THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS TO GET TO ZERO
BillGates_2010-0020272-0021013.wav NOW WE PUT OUT A LOT OF CARBON DIOXIDE EVER YEAR NOW OVER TWENTY SIX BILLION TONS OFFER EACH AMERICAN
BillGates_2010-0021013-0022431.wav IT'S ABOUT TWENTY TONS AH FOR PEOPLE IN POOR COUNTRIES IT'S LESS THAN ONE TON IT'S AN AVERAGE ABOUT FIVE TONS FOR EVERYONE ON THE PLANET AND SOMEHOW WE HAVE TO MAKE CHANGES THAT WE'LL BRING THAT DOWN TO ZERO
BillGates_2010-0022431-0023917.wav IT HAS BEEN CONSTANTLY GOING UP IT'S ONLY VARIOUS ECONOMIC CHANGES THAT HAVE EVEN FLATTENED IT AT ALL SO HAVE TO GO FROM RAPIDLY RISING TO FALLING AND FALLING ALL THE WAY TO ZERO THIS EQUATION ASKED FOR FACTORS
BillGates_2010-0023917-0024799.wav A LITTLE BIT OF MULTIPLICATION SO'VE GOT IT THING ON THE LEFT SEAL TOO THAT YOU WANT TO GET TO ZERO AND THAT'S GOING TO BE BASED ON THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE
BillGates_2010-0024799-0025683.wav THE SERVICES EACH PERSON USING ON AVERAGE THE ENERGY ON AVERAGE FOR EACH SERVICE AND THE THEO TOO BEING PUT OUT
BillGates_2010-0025683-0026806.wav A PERT UNIT OF ENERGY SO LET'S LOOK AT EACH ONE OF THESE AND SEE HOW WE CAN GET THIS TO OUT INTO ZERO I'LL PROBABLY ONE OF THESE NUMBERS IS GOING TO HAVE TO GET PRETTY NEAR TO CYRIL
BillGates_2010-0026806-0027504.wav AH THAT'S BACK FROM A HIGH SCHOOL OUTBREAD AND LET'S LET'S TAKE A LOOK AH FIRST WE'VE GOT POPULATION
BillGates_2010-0027504-0028543.wav NOW THE WORLD TO DAY HAS SIX POINT EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE THAT'S HEADED UP TO ABOUT NINE BILLION NOW IF WE DO A REALLY GREAT JOB ON NEW BACK SCENES HEALTH CARE
BillGates_2010-0028543-0029430.wav REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES WE COULD LORE THAT BY PERHAPS TEN OR FIFTEEN PER CENT BUT THERE WE SEE AN INCREASE OF A ABOUT ONE POINT THREE
BillGates_2010-0029430-0030042.wav THE SECOND FACTOR IS THE SERVICES WE USE THIS ENCOMPASSES EVERYTHING THE FOOD WE
BillGates_2010-0030042-0031329.wav CLOTHING TEEVIE A HEATING THESE ARE VERY GOOD THINGS A GETTING RID OF POVERTY MEANS PROVIDING THESE SERVICES TO ALMOST EVERYONE ON THE PLANET AND IT'S A GREAT THING
BillGates_2010-0031329-0032116.wav ON FOR THIS NUMBER TO GO UP IN THE RICH WORLD PERHAPS A TOP ON BILLION WE PROBABLY COULD CUT BACK AND USE LESS BUT EVERY YEAR
BillGates_2010-0032116-0032991.wav THIS NUMBER ON AVERAGE IS GOING TO GO UP AND SO OVER ALL THAT WILL MORE THAN DOUBLE THE SERVICES DELIVERED PER PERSON
BillGates_2010-0032991-0034092.wav CAN WE HAVE A VERY BASIC SERVICE DO YOU HAVE LIGHTING IN YOUR HOUSE TO BE ABLE TO READ YOUR HOMEWORK AND IN FACT THESE KIDS DON'T SO THEY'RE GOING OUT IN READING THEIR SCHOOLWORK UNDER THE STREET LAMPS
BillGates_2010-0034238-0035302.wav NOW EFFICIENCY E THE ENERGY FOR EACH SERVICE HERE FINALLY WE HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT S KNOCK WENT UP THROUGH VARIOUS INVENTIONS AND NEW WAYS OF DOING LIGHTING
BillGates_2010-0035302-0036488.wav ARE THROUGH A DIFFERENT TYPES OF CARS OF DIFFERENT WAYS IN BUILDING BUILDINGS THERE ARE A LOT OF SERVICES WHERE YOU CAN BRING THE ENERGY FOR THAT SERVICE DOWN QUITE SUBSTANTIALLY
BillGates_2010-0036488-0037676.wav SOME INDIVIDUAL SERVICES EVEN BRING IT DOWN BY NINETY PER CENT THERE ARE OTHER SERVICES LIKE HOW WE MAKE FOR ELIZER HOW WE DO AIR TRANSPORT WHERE THE ROOMS FOR IMPROVEMENT ARE FAR FAR LESS
BillGates_2010-0037676-0038654.wav AND SO OVER ALL HERE IF WE ARE OPTIMISTIC WE MAY GET A REDUCTION OF A FACTOR OF THREE TO EVEN PERHAPS A FACTOR OF SIX
BillGates_2010-0038654-0039968.wav BUT FOR THESE FIRST RE FACTORS NOW WE'VE GONE FROM TWENTY SIX BILLION TO IT BEST I MAY BE THIRTEEN BILLION TONS AN THAT JUST WON'T CUT IT SO LET'S LOOK AT THIS FOURTH FACTOR NOW THERE'S GOIN TO BE A KEY ONE
BillGates_2010-0039968-0041160.wav AND THIS IS THE AMOUNT OF SEAL TOO PUT OUT FOR EACH UNIT OF ENERGY AND SO THE QUESTION IS CAN YOU ACTUALLY GET THAT TO ZERO AH IF YOU BURN COAL
BillGates_2010-0041160-0042626.wav NO OFF YOU BURNED THAT TO GASCON ALMOST EVERY WAY WE MAKE A LIKE CHRISTIE TO DAY AH EXCEPT I'LL FURT THE EMERGING WERE NOBLES AND NUKLER I'LL PUTS OUT SEAL TOO AND SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO AT A GLOABLE SCALE
BillGates_2010-0042626-0043500.wav IS CREATE A NEW SYSTEM AND SO WE NEED ENERGY MIRACLES NOW WHEN I IS THE TURMERICAL I DON'T MEAN SOMETHING THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE
BillGates_2010-0043596-0044976.wav THE MICRO PROCESSOR IS A MIRACLE THE PERSONAL COMPUTERS A MIRACLE OF THE INNER NETINATE SERVICES ARE A MIRACLE SO THE PEOPLE HERE HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THE CREATION OF MANY MIRACLES USUALLY WE DON'T HAVE A DEAD LINE
BillGates_2010-0044976-0046458.wav WE HAVE TO GET THE MIRACLE BY A CERTAIN DATE USUALLY JUST KIND OF STAND BY AND SOME COME ALONG SOME DON'T THIS IS A CASE WHERE WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO DRIVE AT FULL SPEED AND GET A MIRACLE IN A A PRETTY TIGHT TIME LINE
BillGates_2010-0046458-0047510.wav NOW I THOUGHT HOW COULD I REALLY CAPTURE THIS IS THERE SOME KIND OF NATURAL ILLUSTRATION SOME DEMONSTRATION THAT WOULD GRAB PEOPLE'S IMAGINATION HERE
BillGates_2010-0047510-0048185.wav I THOUGHT BACK TO A YEAR AGO WHEN I BROUGHT MOSQUITOES AND SOMEHOW NOT PEOPLE ENJOYED THAT
BillGates_2010-0048307-0049689.wav IT REALLY GOT THEM INVOLVED IN THE IDEA A YOU DON'T OTHER PEOPLE WHO LIVE INSQUITO SO WITH ENERGY I LIKE TO COME UP WHAT IS THIS AH I DECIDED THAT RELEASING FIREFLIES
BillGates_2010-0049689-0050893.wav WOULD BE MY A CONTRIBUTION TO THE ENVIRONMENT HERE THIS YEAR SO HERE WE HAVE A SOME NATURAL FLIES I'M TOLD THEY DON'T BITE IN FACT THEY MIGHT EVEN NOT EVEN LEAVE THAT JAR AH
BillGates_2010-0051081-0052222.wav NOW THERE'S ALL SORTS OF GIMMICKY SOLUTIONS LIKE THAT ONE AH BUT THEY DON'T REALLY ADD UP TOO MUCH WE NEED SOLUTIONS EITHER ONE OR SEVERAL THAT HAVE
BillGates_2010-0052222-0053287.wav UNBELIEVABLE SCALE AND UNBLY BORE LIABILITY AND ALTHOUGH THERE IS MANY DIRECTIONS OR PEOPLE SEEKING I REALLY ONLY SEE FIVE THAT
BillGates_2010-0053287-0054552.wav CAN ACHIEVE THE BIG NUMBERS I'VE LEFT OUT TIED GEOLTURMAL FUSION BY A FUELS THOSE MAY MAKE SOME CONTRIBUTION AND IF THEY CAN DO BETTER THAN I EXPECT SO MUCH THE BETTER BUT MY KEY POINT HERE
BillGates_2010-0054552-0055462.wav AS THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WORK ON EACH OF THESE LIVE AND WE CAN'T GIVE UP ANY OF THEM AH BECAUSE THEY LOOK DAUNTING BECAUSE THEY ALL
BillGates_2010-0055462-0056432.wav HAVE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES I LET'S LOOK FIRST AT THE BURNING POSS OF FUELS EITHER ON BURNING COAL OR BURNING NOW TO GAS WHAT YOU MEAN TO DO THERE
BillGates_2010-0056493-0057694.wav SEEMS LIKE IT MIGHT BE SIMPLE BUT IT'S NOT AND THAT'S TO TAKE ALL THE SEA OR TWO AFTER YOU'VE BURN IT GOING OUT THE FLUE PRESS RISE IT CREED A LIQUID PUT IT SOMEWHERE AND HOPE IT STAYS THERE
BillGates_2010-0057694-0059039.wav NOW WE HAVE SOME PILOT THINGS THAT DO THIS AT THE SIXTY EIGHTY PER CENT LEVEL BUT GETTING UP TO THAT FULL PERCENTAGE THAT WILL BE VERY TRICKY AND A GREEN ON WHERE THESE SEAL TOO QUANTITY SHOULD BE PUT
BillGates_2010-0059039-0059716.wav WILL BE HARD BUT THE TOUGHEST ONE HERE IS THIS LONG TO MICHAUD WHO'S CAN TO BE SURE WHO'S GOING TO GUARANTEE
BillGates_2010-0059716-0060724.wav AH SOMETHING THAT IS LITERALLY BILLIONS OF TIMES LARGER THAN ANY TYPE OF WASTE YOU THINK OF AN IN TERMS OF NUCLEAR OTHER THINGS THIS IS A LOT OF OIL
BillGates_2010-0060724-0061801.wav SO THAT'S A TOP ONE NEXT IT BE NUGGLER IT ALSO HAS THREE BIG PROBLEMS COSTS PARTICULARLY IN HIGHLY REGULATED COUNTRIES IS HIGH
BillGates_2010-0061801-0062663.wav THE ISSUE OF THE SAFETY REALLY FEELING GOOD ABOUT NOTHING CAN GO WRONG THAT HE CAN KNOW YOU HAVE THESE HUMAN OPERATORS THAT THE FUEL
BillGates_2010-0062663-0064182.wav DOESN'T GET USED FOR WEAPONS AND THEN WEAR WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE WASTE ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT VERY LARGE OTHER A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT THAT PEOPLE MEAN TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT SO THREE VERY TOM PROBLEMS OF THAT MIGHT BE ASOLVABLE AND SO SHOULD BE WORKED ON
BillGates_2010-0064182-0065029.wav THE LAST THREE OF THE FIVE I GROUPED TOGETHER AH THESE ARE WHAT PEOPLE OFTEN REFER TO HIS THE RENEWABLE SOURCES AND THEY ACTUALLY
BillGates_2010-0065029-0065802.wav ALTHOUGH IT'S GREAT THEY DON'T QUAIL FUEL THEY HAVE SOME DISADVANTAGES ONE IS THAT THE DENSITY
BillGates_2010-0065802-0066489.wav AN ENERGY GATHER IN THESE TECHNITIES IS DRAMATICALLY LESS THAN A POWER PLANT THIS IS ENERGY FARMING
BillGates_2010-0066489-0067666.wav SIR TALKING ABOUT MANY SQUARE MILES THOUSANDS OF TIMES MORE AREA THAN THEN YOU THINK OF ITS NORMAL ENERGY PLANT ALSO THESE ARE INTERMITTENT SOURCES AH THE SUN DOESN'T SHINE
BillGates_2010-0067666-0068350.wav ALL DAY DOESN'T SHINE EVERY DAY AND LIKEWISE THE WIND DOESN'T BLOW ALL THE TIME AND SO DO YOU DEPEND ON THESE SOURCES
BillGates_2010-0068350-0069211.wav YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME WAY OF GETTING ENERGY DURING THOSE TIME PERIODS THAT IT'S NOT AVAILABLE SO WE'VE GOT BIG COST CHALLENGES HERE
BillGates_2010-0069211-0070665.wav AH WE HAVE TRANSMISSION CHALLENGES FOR EXAMPLE SAVE THIS ENERGY SOURCES OUTSIDE YOUR COUNTRY I NOT ONLY NEED THE TECHNOLOGY BUT YOU HAVE TO A DEAL WITH THE RISK OF THE ENERGY COMING FROM ELSEWHERE AND FINALLY THIS STORAGE PROBLEM
BillGates_2010-0070665-0071808.wav AND TO DIMENSIONIZE THIS I WENT THROUGH AND LOOKED AT ALL THE TYPES OF BATTERIES THAT GET MADE FOR CARS FOR COMPUTERS FOR FOGS FOR FLASHLIGHTS FOR EVERYTHING AND COMPARED THAT
BillGates_2010-0071808-0072717.wav TO THE AMOUNT OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY THE WORLD USES AND WHEN I FOUND IS THAT ALL THE BATTERIES WE MAKE NOW COULD STORE LESS THAN TEN MINUTES
BillGates_2010-0072717-0073409.wav OF ALL THE ENERGY AND SO IN FACT WE NEED A BIG BRAKE THROUGH HERE SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE
BillGates_2010-0073409-0074885.wav A FACTOR OF A HUNDRED BETTER THAN THE APPROACHES WE HAVE NOW IT'S NOT IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE BUT IT'S NOT A VERY EASY THING NOW THIS SHOWS UP WHEN YOU TRY TO GET THE INTERMENTANT SOURCE TO BE ABOVE SAY TWENTY TO THIRTY PER CENT
BillGates_2010-0074885-0075717.wav OF WHAT YOU'RE USING IF YOU WERE COUNTING ON IT FOR A HUNDRED PER CENT YOU NEED A AN INCREDIBLE MIRACLE BATTERY
BillGates_2010-0075717-0076673.wav NOW HOW WE'RE GOING TO GO FOR IT ON THIS WHAT'S WHAT'S THE RIGHT APPROACH IS IT A MAN HAT AND PROJECT WHAT'S THE THING THAT CAN GET US THERE WELL WE NEED WANTS
BillGates_2010-0076673-0077744.wav OF COMPANIES A WORKING ON THIS HUNDREDS IN EACH OF THESE FIVE PATHS WE NEED AT LEAST A HUNDRED PEOPLE AND LOT OF EM YOU LOOK AT SAY THEY'RE CRAZY THAT'S GOOD
BillGates_2010-0077744-0078466.wav AND I THINK HERE IN THE TED GROUP WE HAVE MANY PEOPLE A WHO ARE ALREADY PURSUING THIS A
BillGates_2010-0078466-0080389.wav BILL GROSS HAS SEVERAL COMPANIES IN CLEAN ONE CALLED E SOLAR THAT HAS SOME GREAT SOLAR THERMAL TECHNOLOGY AVENOWED COAST US INVESTING IN DOZENS OF COMPANIES AH THAT ARE DOING GREAT THINGS AND HAVE ON INTERESTING POSSIBILITIES AND I'M I'M TRYING TO HELP BACK THAT I NEED THE MARVEL THEN I AXE YOUR BACK IN IT A COMPANY
BillGates_2010-0080389-0081193.wav THAT PERHAPS SURPRISINGLY IS ACTUALLY TAKING THE NUCLEAR APPROACH AND THERE ARE SOME INNOVATIONS IN NUCLEAR MODULOR LIQUID
BillGates_2010-0081193-0082339.wav AH AN INNOVATION REALLY STOPPED IN THIS INDUSTRY QUITE SOME TIME AGO TO THE IDEA THAT THERE'S SOME GOOD IDEAS LAIN AROUND AH IS NOT ALL THAT SURPRISING THE IDEA OF A TERROR POWER
BillGates_2010-0082339-0083304.wav IS THAT INSTEAD OF BURNING THE PART OF URANIUM THE ONE PER CENT WHICH IS THAT YOU TWO THIRTY FIVE WE DECIDED WELL LET'S BURN THE NINETY NINE PER CENT
BillGates_2010-0083304-0084018.wav THE U TWO THIRTY EIGHT IT IS KIND OF A CRAZY IDEA AND FACT PEOPLE HAD TALKED ABOUT IT FOR A LONG TIME
BillGates_2010-0084018-0085031.wav BUT THEY COULD NEVER SIMULATE PROMPTLY WHETHER IT WOULD WORK OR NOT AND SO THROUGH THE ADVENT OF MODERN SUPER COMPUTERS THAT NOW YOU CAN SIMULATE AND SEE THAT YES WITH THE RIGHT
BillGates_2010-0085031-0085894.wav MATERIALS APPROACH AH THIS ALL LOOKS LIKE IT WOULD WORK AND BECAUSE YOU'RE BURNING THAT NINETY NINE PER CENT I YOU HAVE
BillGates_2010-0085894-0087360.wav A GREATLY IMPROVED COST ON PROFILE YOU ACTUALLY BURN UP THE WASTE AND YOU CANNOT USE AS FUEL ALL THE LEFT OVER WASTE FROM TO DAY'S REACTORS AND SO INSTEAD OF WEARING ABOUT THEM YOU JUST TAKE THAT IT'S A GREAT THING
BillGates_2010-0087360-0088384.wav IT BREEDS THIS EURANIUM AS IT GOES ALONG SUCH COLOUR LIKE THE CANDLEING SEATS IT'S A LOG THERE OFTEN REFERRED TO HIS A TRAVELLING WAVE RE ACTOR IN TERMS OF FUEL
BillGates_2010-0088384-0089691.wav AH THIS REALLY SOLVES THE PROBLEM I'VE GOT A PICTURE HERE OF A PLACE IN KENTUCKY THIS IS THE LEFT OVER THE NINETY NINE PER CENT WHERE THEY TAKEN OUT THE PART THEY WERE NOW SO'S CALLED DEPLETED URANIUM THAT WOULD POWER THE U S
BillGates_2010-0089691-0090681.wav FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS AND SIMPLY BY FILTERING SEA WATER IN AN INEXPENSIVE PROCESS YET HAVE ENOUGH FUEL FOR THE ENTIRE LIFETIME OF THE REST OF THE PLANET SO
BillGates_2010-0090681-0091781.wav YOU KNOW IT'S GOT LOTS LOTS OF CHALLENGES I HAD BUT IT IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE MANY HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF IDEAS THAT WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD
BillGates_2010-0091781-0093270.wav SO LET'S THINK HOW SHOULD WE MEASURE OURSELVES WHAT SHOULD OUR REPORT CARD I'LL LOOK LIKE WELL LET'S GO OUT TO WHERE WE REALLY NEED TO GET IN AND THEN I'LL LOOK AT THE INTERMEDIATE FOR TWENTY FIFTY YOU'VE HEARD MANY PEOPLE TALK ABOUT
BillGates_2010-0093270-0094056.wav THIS EIGHTY PER CENT REDUCTION THAT REALLY IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE GET THERE AND THAT TWENTY PER CENT WILL BE USED UP BY
BillGates_2010-0094056-0095342.wav THINGS GOING ON IN POOR COUNTRIES STILL SOME AGRICULTURE I HOPEFULLY WE WILL HAVE CLEANED UP A FOREST RE CEMENT AH SO TO GET TO THAT EIGHTY PER CENT THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES
BillGates_2010-0095342-0096309.wav INCLUDING COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA WILL HAVE HAD TO SWITCH THEIR ELECTRONIC ELECTRICITY GENERATION ALL TOGETHER AH SO THE OTHER GREATEST ARE WE DEPLOIN
BillGates_2010-0096309-0097289.wav THIS ZYRIMISSION TECHNOLOGY HAVE WE DEPLOITED IN ALL THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES AND WERE IN THE PROCESSIVE OF GETTING IT OUT ELSEWHERE THAT SUPER IMPORTANT
BillGates_2010-0097289-0098146.wav AT THE KEY ELEMENT OF MAKING THAT REPORT CARD SO BACKING UP FROM THERE WHAT SHOULD THE TWENTY TWENTY REPORT CARD LOOKED LIKE
BillGates_2010-0098146-0099642.wav WELL IT AGAIN IT SHOULD HAVE THE TWO ELEMENTS AND WE SHOULD GO THROUGH THESE EFFICIENCY MEASURES TO START GETTING REDUCTIONS THE LESS WE ADMIT THE LESS THAT SUM WILL BE OF SEAL TWO AND THEREFORE THE LESS THE TEMPERATURE BUT IN SOME WAYS THE GRADE WE GET THERE
BillGates_2010-0099642-0100725.wav DOING THINGS THAT DON'T GET US ALL THE WAY TO THE BIG REDUCTIONS IS ONLY EQUALLY OR MADE EVEN SLIGHTLY LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE OTHER WHICH IS THE PIECE OF INNOVATION
BillGates_2010-0100725-0101719.wav ON THESE BREAK THROUGHS THESE BREAK THROUGHS WE NEED TO MOVE THOSE AT FULL SPEED AND WE CAN MEASURE THAT IN TERMS OF COMPANIES PILOT PROJECTS REGULARATORY THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN CHANGED
BillGates_2010-0101719-0103401.wav THERE'S A LOT OF GREAT BOOKS THE MEN WRITTEN ABOUT THIS THE ALGOR BOOK ARE CHOICE AND THE DAVID MACKAY BOOK THE STAINABLE ENERGY WITHOUT THE HOT AIR THEY REALLY GO THROUGH IT AND I THINK CAN GRATE OUT OF FRAME WORK THAT THIS CAN BE DISCUSSED BROADLY BECAUSE WE NEED BROAD BACKING FOR THIS
BillGates_2010-0103401-0104035.wav OTHERS A LOT THAT HAS TO COME TOGETHER SO THIS IS A WISH IT'S A VERY CONCRETE WISH THAT
BillGates_2010-0104035-0104905.wav WE INVENT THIS TECHNOLOGY IF YOU GAVE ME ONLY ONE WISH FOR THE NEXT FIFTH YEARS I CAN PICK WHOSE PRESIDENT I CAN PICK A VAXINE
BillGates_2010-0104905-0105571.wav WHICH WAS SOMETHING I LOVE OR I COULD PICK THAT THIS THING THAT'S HALF THE COST WITH MONSIEUR TWO GETS INVENTED
BillGates_2010-0105571-0106601.wav THIS IS THE WISH I WOULD PICK THIS IS THE ONE OF THE GREATEST IMPACT AND WE DON'T GET THIS WISH THE DIVISION BETWEEN THE PEOPLE WHO THINK SHORT TERM A LONG TERM WILL BE TERRIBLE
BillGates_2010-0106601-0107999.wav BETWEEN YOU US AND CHINA BETWEEN POOR COUNTRIES AND RICH AND MOST OF ALL THE LIVES OF THOSE TWO BILLION WILL BE FAR WORSE SO WHAT DO WE HAVE TO DO WHAT AM I APPEALING ASKED YOU TO I'LL STEP FORWARD AND
BillGates_2010-0107999-0108733.wav AND DRIVE WE NEED IT TO GO FROM WAR RESEARCH FUNDING AND WHEN COUNTRIES GET TOGETHER A PLACES LIKE COPENHAGEN NATION
BillGates_2010-0108733-0109597.wav JUST DISCUSS THE SEAL TOO THEY SHOULD DISCUSS THIS INNOVATION AGENDA AND YOU'D BE STUNNED AT THE RIDICULOUSLY LOW LEVELS OF SPENDING
BillGates_2010-0109597-0110464.wav ON THESE INNOVATED APPROACHES WE DIDN'T DO NEED THE MARKET IN SANUS SEALED TWO TACKS CAP AND TRADE SOMETHING THAT GETS THAT PRICE SIGNAL OUT THERE
BillGates_2010-0110464-0111838.wav WE NEED TO GET THE MESSAGE OUT WE NEED HAVE THIS DIALOGUE BE A MORE RASH AND MORE UNDERSTANDABLE DIALOGUE ON INCLUDING THE STEPS THAT THE GOVERNMENT TAKES THIS IS AN IMPORTANT WISH BUT IT IS ONE I THINK WE CAN ACHIEVE THANK YOU
BillGates_2010-0113236-0113383.wav THANK HER THANK HER
BillGates_2010-0113940-0114550.wav THANK YOU I AM SET TO UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT ABOUT A TERROR POWER RIGHT UM
BillGates_2010-0114550-0115006.wav WE FIRST THOUGHT WHAT CAN GIVE A SENSE WHAT SORT OF SCALE OF INVESTMENT THIS IS
BillGates_2010-0115006-0116124.wav BUT TO THE ACTUALLY DO THIS SOFT WHEREBY THE SUPERCOMPUTER HIRE ALL THE GREAT SCIENTISTS WHICH WE'VE DONE THAT'S ONLY TENS OF MILLIONS AND EVEN ONCE WE TEST OUR MATERIALS OUT
BillGates_2010-0116124-0117033.wav AH IN A RUSSIAN REACTOR TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR MATERIALS WORK PROPERLY THEN YOU'LL ONLY BE UP IN HUNDREDS MILLIONS THE TOUGHING IS BUILDING THE PILOT REACTOR
BillGates_2010-0117033-0117995.wav AH FINDING THE SEVERAL BILLION I FINDING THE REGULATOR THE LOCATION THAT WILL ACTUALLY BUILD THE FIRST ONE OF THESE WHEN SHOULD GET THE FIRST ONE BUILT
BillGates_2010-0117995-0118832.wav IF IT WORKS AS ADVERTISE THEN IT'S JUST CLEAR AS DAY BECAUSE THE ECONOMIC'S THE ENERGY DENSITY ARE SO DIFFERENT THEN NUCLERS WE KNOW IT
BillGates_2010-0118832-0120110.wav AND SET TO UNDERSTAND IT RIGHT THIS INVOLVES BUILDING DEEP INTO THE GROUND ON US LIKE LIKE A VERTICAL CAN A COLUMN OF NUCLEUR FUEL OF THIS SO TO SPENT URANIUM AND THEN A MINUTE AND THEN THE PRECIOUS STARTS AT THE TOP AND CAN OF WORK DOWN
BillGates_2010-0120110-0121078.wav THAT'S RIGHT TO DAY YOU ARE ALWAYS REFUSING THE REACTRACY OF LOTS OF PEOPLE AND LOTS OF CONTROLS THAT CAN GO WRONG THAT THING WE ARE OPENING IT UP AND MOVING THINGS IN AND OUT THAT'S
BillGates_2010-0121078-0121893.wav THAT'S NOT GOOD SO IF YOU HADN'T VERY VERY CHEAP FUEL THEN YOU CAN PUT SIXTY YEARS IN JUST THINK OF IT AS A LOG
BillGates_2010-0121893-0122743.wav PUT IT DOWN AND NOT HAVE THOSE SAME COMPLEXITIES AND IT JUST SITS THERE AND BURNS FOR THE SIX YEARS AH AND THEN IT'S DONE
BillGates_2010-0122743-0123156.wav IT'S THAT ITS A NEW CLEAR PARAPONDER IS ITS OWN WASTE DISPOSAL SOLUTION
BillGates_2010-0123156-0124289.wav YET WILL WIN HAMMONDS WITH THE WASTE YOU CAN YOU CAN LET IT SIT THERE AH THERE'S A LOT LESS WASTE UNDER THIS APPROACH AH THEN YOU CAN ACTUALLY TAKE THAT AND PUT IT INTO ANOTHER ONE AND BURN THAT
BillGates_2010-0124289-0125283.wav AND AND WE START OUT ACTUALLY BY TAKING THE WASTE THAT EXISTS TO DAY THAT SITTING IN THESE COOLING POOLS ARE DRYCASTING BY REACTORS THAT'S OUR FUEL
BillGates_2010-0125283-0126334.wav TO BEGIN WITH SO THE THING THAT'S BEEN A PROBLEM FROM THOSE REACTORS IS ACTUALLY WHAT GETS FED INTO OURS AND YOU'RE REDUCING THE VOLUME OF THE RACE QUITE DRAMATICALLY AS YOU'RE GOING THROUGH THIS PROCESS
BillGates_2010-0126334-0127077.wav HAVEN'T YOU TALKING TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD ABOUT THE POSSIBILITIES HERE WHERE WHERE IS THEIR MOST INTEREST IN ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING WITH THIS
BillGates_2010-0127077-0127994.wav WELL WE ON IT I PICKED A PARTICULAR PLACE BUT AH AND THERE'S ALL THESE INTERESTING DISCLOSURE RULES HAVE BY ANYTHING IT'S CALLED NUCLEAR
BillGates_2010-0128098-0129028.wav SO IT WE'VE GOT A LOT OF INTEREST AH THE PEOPLE FROM THE COMPANY HAVE BEEN IN RUSH AND INDIA CHINA I'VE BEEN BACK SEEN THE SECRETARY OF ENERGY HERE TALKING ABOUT HOW THIS
BillGates_2010-0129028-0130155.wav AH FITS INTO THE THE ENERGY AGENDA SUM OPTIMISTIC AH UNDER THE FRENCH AND JAPANESE HAVE DONE SOME WORK THIS IS A A VARIANT ON SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN DONE IT IS AN IMPORTANT
BillGates_2010-0130155-0131091.wav ADVANCED BUT IT'S LIKE A FAST RACTOR IN A LOT OF COMP COUNTRIES OF BUILT THEM SO ANYBODY WAS NOT A PATH RACTOR IS A CANDIDATE TO TO BE WHERE THE PURSE ONE GETS BUILT
BillGates_2010-0131091-0131937.wav SO IN IN YOUR MIND AM TIME SCALE AND LIKELIHOOD ARE ACTUALLY TAKING SECOND LIKE THIS LIFE
BillGates_2010-0131937-0132214.wav WHAT WE NEED FOR ONE OF THESE
BillGates_2010-0132214-0133186.wav HIGH SKILL ELECTRIC ELECTRO GENERATION THINGS THAT'S VERY CHEAP WE HAVE TWENTY YEARS TO INVENT AND THEN TWENTY YEARS TO DEPLOY THAT SORT OF THE DEAD LINE
BillGates_2010-0133186-0134086.wav THAT THE ENVIRONED MODELS AND VERY LITTLE MODELSIVE HAVE SHOWN US THAT WE HAVE TO MEET AND IN A TERROR POWER IF THINGS GO WELL
BillGates_2010-0134086-0134899.wav AH WHICH IS WISHING FOR LOT COULD EASILY MEET THAT AND THERE ARE A FORTUNATELY NOW DOZENS OF COMPANIES WE NEED TO BE HUNDREDS
BillGates_2010-0134899-0136283.wav WHO LIKEWISE IF THEIR SCIENCE GOES WELL IF THE FUNNY FOR THEIR PLANT PILOT PLANTS GOES WELL THAT THEY THEY CAN KEEP FOR THIS AND ITS BASKET MULTIPLE SUCCEED BECAUSE THEY NEED USE A MIX A MIX OF THESE THINGS WE CERTAINLY NEED ONE TO SUCCEED
BillGates_2010-0136283-0136854.wav IN TERMS OF BIG SCALE POSSIBLE GAME CHANGES THAT IT IS THE BIGGEST THAT YOU'RE AWARE ABOUT THERE
BillGates_2010-0136854-0137835.wav AN ENERGY BREAK THROUGH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN WITHOUT THE ENVIRON MELICON STRENGTH BUT THE ENVIRONMENT CONTRACT JUST MAKES THAT SO MUCH
BillGates_2010-0137924-0138694.wav SO MUCH GREATER IN THE NEW GLARE SPACE THERE ARE OTHER ANIMATORS AH IN IT WE DON'T KNOW THEIR WORK AS WELL AS WE KNOW THIS ONE BUT
BillGates_2010-0138694-0139478.wav THE MOGILER PEOPLE NOW THAT'S A DIFFERENT APPROACH THERE'S A LIQUID TYPE REACTER WHICH SEEMS LITTLE HARD BUT MAYBE THEY SAY ABOUT US
BillGates_2010-0139591-0140511.wav AND SO THERE ARE DIFFERENT ONES BUT THE BEAUTY THIS IS A MOLECULE GERANIUM HAS A MILLION TIMES AS MUCH ENERGY AS A MOLECULE OF SAY COAL
BillGates_2010-0140590-0141946.wav AND SO IF YOU CAN DEAL WITH THE NEGATIVES WHICH ARE ESSENTIALLY THE RADIATION THE FOOTPRINT AND COST THE POTENTIAL AND TERMS OF EFFECT ON LAND AND VARIOUS THINGS IS IN ALMOST IN A CLASS OF ITS OWN
BillGates_2010-0142125-0142221.wav IF THIS DOESN'T LET
BillGates_2010-0142431-0143126.wav THEN WHAT DO WE HAVE TO START TAKING EMERGENCY MEASURES TO TRY AND KEEP THE TEMPERATURE OF THE EARTH STABLE

DanBarber_2010-0077319-0077893.wav YET WHEN I TASTED IT AT THAT RESTAURANT IN SOUTHERN SPAIN IT TASTED NOT AT ALL LIKE FRISKIN
DanBarber_2010-0078008-0078185.wav A TASTED SWEET AND CLEAN
DanBarber_2010-0078271-0078514.wav LIKE YOU ARE TAKING A BITE OF THE OCEAN
DanBarber_2010-0078574-0079349.wav I MENTIONED THAT TO ME GALLON HE NODDED HE SAID THE SKIN ACTS LIKE A SPONGE SO LAST OFFENCE BEFORE ANYTHING ENTERS THE BODY IT HE EVOLVED
DanBarber_2010-0079349-0079613.wav TO SOAK UP IMPURITIES AND THEN HE ADDED
DanBarber_2010-0079673-0079983.wav BUT OUR WATER HAS NO IMPURITIES
DanBarber_2010-0080207-0080499.wav A FARM A DOZEN FEET ITS FISH
DanBarber_2010-0080634-0080923.wav A FARM THE MEASURES IN SUCCESS
DanBarber_2010-0080923-0081110.wav BY THE SUCCESS OF ITS CREDITORS
DanBarber_2010-0081181-0081391.wav AND THEN I REALIZE WHEN HE SAYS
DanBarber_2010-0081391-0082273.wav A FARM THAT HAS NO IMPURITIES HE MADE A BIG UNDER STATEMENT BECAUSE THE WATER THAT FLOWS THROUGH THAT FARM COMES IN FROM THE GUADAL OF YOUR RIVER
DanBarber_2010-0082334-0082802.wav THE RIVER THE CARRIES WITH IT ALL THE THINGS THE RIVERS TEND TO CARRY THESE DAYS
DanBarber_2010-0082865-0083146.wav CHEMICAL CONTAMINANCE TEST ASIDE RUN OFF
DanBarber_2010-0083197-0083423.wav AND WHEN IT WORKS ITS WAY THROUGH THE SYSTEM
DanBarber_2010-0083562-0083908.wav AND LEAVES THE WATER IT'S CLEANER THAN WHEN IT ENTERED
DanBarber_2010-0083980-0084238.wav THE SYSTEM IS SO HEALTHY IT PURIFIES THE WATER
DanBarber_2010-0084369-0084757.wav SO NOT JEST A FARM A DOZEN FEET IT DOWN WAS NOT JEST A FARM THE MEASURES THE HEALTH
DanBarber_2010-0084820-0085015.wav MADE IT SUCCESS BY THE HEALTH OF ITS CREDITORS
DanBarber_2010-0085085-0085415.wav BUT A FARM THAT'S LITERALLY A WATER PURIFICATION PLANT
DanBarber_2010-0085611-0085796.wav AND NOT JUST FOR THOSE FISH
DanBarber_2010-0085982-0086400.wav BUT FOR YOU AND ME AS WELL BECAUSE WHEN THAT WATER LEAVES IT DUMPS OUT INTO THE ATLANTIC
DanBarber_2010-0086695-0087071.wav DROP IN THE OCEAN I KNOW BUT I'LL TAKE IT AND SO SHOULD YOU
DanBarber_2010-0087177-0087373.wav BECAUSE THIS LOVE STORY

DanBarber_2010-0088805-0089444.wav WHAT WE MEAN NOW IS A RADICALLY NEW CONCEPTION OF AGRICULTURE ONE IN WHICH THE FOOD ACTUALLY TASTES GOOD

DanBarber_2010-0090408-0090654.wav THAT'S A BIT TOO RADICAL
DanBarber_2010-0090654-0090948.wav WERE NOT REALISTS AS FOOD IS

DanBarber_2010-0111204-0111624.wav BECAUSE IT THAT'S THE FUTURE OF GOOD FOOD IT'S GOING TO BE DELICIOUS THANK YOU
DanielKahneman_2010-0001580-0001832.wav EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT HAPPINESS THESE DAYS
DanielKahneman_2010-0001946-0002528.wav I HAD SOMEBODY COUNTED THE NUMBER OF BOOKS WITH HAPPINESS IN THE TITLE PUBLISHED IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS
DanielKahneman_2010-0002528-0002975.wav AND THEY GAVE UP AFTER ABOUT FORTY AND THERE WERE MANY MORE
DanielKahneman_2010-0002975-0003857.wav THERE IS A HUGE WAVE OF INTEREST IN HAPPINESS AMONG RESEARCHES THERE IS A LOT OF HAPPINESS COACHING EVERYBODY WOULD LIKE TO MAKE PEOPLE HAPPIER
DanielKahneman_2010-0004006-0004852.wav BUT IN SPITE OF ALL THIS FLOOD OF WORK THERE ARE SEVERAL COGNIVE TRAPS THATS WOULD NOT MAKE IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO THINK STRAIGHT ABOUT HAPPINESS
DanielKahneman_2010-0004852-0006211.wav AND MY TALK TO DAY WILL BE MOSTLY ABOVE THESE CONJUGATIVE TRAPS THIS APPLIES TO LAY PEOPLE THINKING OF THEIR OWN HAPPINESS AND IT A PLACE TO SCHOLARS THINKING ABOUT HAPPINESS BECAUSE IT TURNS OUTWARD JUST AS BEST UP AS ANYBODY ELSE'S
DanielKahneman_2010-0006342-0007634.wav THE FIRST OF THESE TRAP IS A RELUCTANCE TO ADMIT COMPLEXITY TURNS OUT THAT THE WORD HAPPINESS IS JUST NOT A USEFUL WORD ANY MORE BECAUSE WE APPLY TO TOO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS
DanielKahneman_2010-0007634-0008899.wav I THINK THERE IS ONE PARTICULAR MEANING FOR TO WHICH WE MIGHT RESTRICTED BUT BY AND LARGE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WILL HAVE TO GIVE UP AND WILL HAVE TO ADOPT THE MORE COMPLICATED VIEW OF WHAT WELL BEING IS
DanielKahneman_2010-0008899-0010499.wav THE SECOND TRAP IS A CONFUSION BETWEEN EXPERIENCE AND MEMORY BASECLEATES BETWEEN BEING HAPPY IN YOUR LIFE AND BEING HAPPY ABOUT YOUR LIFE FOR HAPPY WITH YOUR LIFE AND THOSE ARE TOO VERY DIFFERENT CONCEPTS AND THEY ARE BOTH LUMPED IN THE NOTION OF HAPPINESS
DanielKahneman_2010-0010499-0011979.wav AND THE THIRD IS IT'S THE FOCUSSING ILLUSION AND IT'S THE UNFORTUNATE FACT THAT WE CAN'T THINK ABOUT ANY CIRCUMSTANCE THAT EFFECTS WILL BE WITHOUT DISTORTING ITS IMPORTANCE AND IN THIS IS A REAL COGNITIVE TRAP THERE IS JUST NO WAY OF GETTING IT DRY
DanielKahneman_2010-0012127-0012679.wav NOW I'D LIKE TO START WITH AN EXAMPLE OF SOMEBODY
DanielKahneman_2010-0012679-0013063.wav WHO HAD A QUESTION IN ANSWER ASSERTION AFTER ONE OF MY LECTURES
DanielKahneman_2010-0013063-0013647.wav REPORTED A STORY AND THAT WITH A STORY HE SAID HE HAD BEEN LISTENING TO A SYMPHONY
DanielKahneman_2010-0013647-0014677.wav AND IT WAS ABSOLUTELY GLORIOUS MUSIC AND AT THE VERY END OF THE RECORDING THERE WAS A DREADFUL SCREECHING SOUND AND THEN HE ADDED READING QUITE EMOTIONALLY
DanielKahneman_2010-0014677-0014982.wav IT RUINED THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE
DanielKahneman_2010-0014982-0015251.wav BUT IT HADN'T
DanielKahneman_2010-0015251-0016819.wav WHEN IT HAD RUINED WITH THE MEMORY OF THE EXPERIENCE HE HAD HAD THE EXPERIENCE HE HAD HAD TWENTY MINUTES OF GLORIOUS MUSIC THEY COUNTED FOR NOTHING BECAUSE HE WAS LEFT WITH A MEMORY THE MEMORY WAS RUINED AND THE MEMORY WAS ALL THAT HE HAD GOTTEN TO KEEP
DanielKahneman_2010-0016819-0017863.wav WHAT THIS IS TELLING US REALLY IS THAT WE MIGHT BE THINKING OF OURSELVES AND OF OTHER PEOPLE IN TERMS OF TWO SELVES AH THERE IS AN EXPERIENCING SELF
DanielKahneman_2010-0017863-0018198.wav WHO LIVES IN THE PRESENCE
DanielKahneman_2010-0018198-0019632.wav AND KNOWS THE PRESENT CAPABLE OF RELIVING THE PAST THE BASICALLY IT HAS ONLY THE PRESENT IT'S THE EXPERIENCING SELF THAT THE DOCTOR APPROACHES YOU KNOW WHEN THE DOCTOR ASKED DOES IT HURT NOW WHEN I TOUCH YOU HERE
DanielKahneman_2010-0019632-0019893.wav AND THEN THERE IS A REMEMBERING SELF
DanielKahneman_2010-0019893-0020282.wav AND THE REMEMBERING SELF IS THE ONE THAT KEEPS SCORE
DanielKahneman_2010-0020282-0020793.wav AND MAINTAINS THE STORY OF ALL LIFE AND IT'S THE ONE THAT THE DOCTOR
DanielKahneman_2010-0020793-0021056.wav APPROACHES IN ASKING THE QUESTION
DanielKahneman_2010-0021249-0022118.wav HOW HAVE YOU BEEN FEELING LATELY OR HOW HAS YOUR TRIP TO URBANIA SOMETHING LIKE THAT THOSE ARE TWO VERY DIFFERENT ENTITIES THE EXPERIENCING SELF
DanielKahneman_2010-0022118-0022829.wav AND THE END THE REMEMBERING SELF AND GETTING CONFUSED BETWEEN THEM IS PART OF A MESS ABOUT THE NOTION OF HAPPINESS
DanielKahneman_2010-0022960-0023341.wav NOW THE REMEMBERING SELF
DanielKahneman_2010-0023341-0023780.wav IS A STORY TELLER AND THAT REALLY STARTS WITH A BASE SICK
DanielKahneman_2010-0023780-0025112.wav RESPONSE OF OUR MEMORY STARTS IMMEDIATELY WE DON'T ONLY TELL STORIES WHEN WE SET OUT TO TELL STORIES OUR MEMORY TELLS OUR STORIES THAT IS WHAT WE GET TO KEEP FROM OUR EXPERIENCES IS A STORY
DanielKahneman_2010-0025112-0025498.wav AND LET ME BEGIN WITH ONE EXAMPLE
DanielKahneman_2010-0025498-0026823.wav THIS IS AN OLD STUDY THOSE ARE ACTUAL PATIENCE UNDERGOING A PAINFUL PROCEDURE OF ONE GOING TO DETAIL IT'S NO LONGER PAINFUL THESE DAYS BUT IT WAS PAINFUL WHEN THE SIXTH WHEN THE STUDY WAS RUN IN THE NINETY NINETIES
DanielKahneman_2010-0026823-0027700.wav THERE ARE TO REPORT ON THEIR PAIN EVERY SIXTY SECONDS AND HERE ARE TWO PATIENTS THOSE ARE THEIR RECORDINGS AND WHO ARE ASKED
DanielKahneman_2010-0027700-0028636.wav WHO OF THEM SUFFERED MORE AND IT'S A VERY EASY QUESTION OF IN CLEARLY PATIENT BE SUFFERED MORE HIS COLONNOSCOPIE WAS LONGER AND EVERY EM
DanielKahneman_2010-0028636-0029316.wav MINUTE OF PAIN THAT PATIENT A HAD PATIENT B HAD AND MORE BUT NOW THERE IS ANOTHER QUESTION
DanielKahneman_2010-0029316-0029631.wav HOW MUCH DID THESE PATIENT THINK THEY SUFFERED
DanielKahneman_2010-0029698-0029858.wav AND HERE IS A SURPRISE
DanielKahneman_2010-0029858-0030915.wav AND THE SURPRISES THAT PATIENT A HAD A MUCH WORSE MEMORY OF THE COLONNOSCO PIAN PATIENT B THE STORIES OF THE COLONNOSCOPES WERE DIFFERENT
DanielKahneman_2010-0030915-0031511.wav AND BECAUSE A VERY CRITICAL PART OF THE STORIES HOW IT ENDS
DanielKahneman_2010-0031511-0033046.wav AND NEITHER OF THESE STORIES IS VERY INSPIRING OR GREAT BUT ONE OF THEM IS THIS THING BUT ONE OF THEM IS DISTINCTLY WORSE THAN THE OTHER AND THE ONE THAT IS WORSE IF THE ONE WHERE PAIN WAS AT ITS SPEAK AT THE VERY END
DanielKahneman_2010-0033046-0034448.wav IT'S A BAD STORY HOW DO WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE WE ASK THESE PEOPLE AFTER THEIR COLONELSCOPE AND MUCH LATER TOO HOW BAD WAS THE WHOLE THING IN TOTAL AND IT WAS MUCH WORSE FOR A THAN FOR B IN MEMORY
DanielKahneman_2010-0034448-0035446.wav NOW THIS IS A DIRECT CONFLICT BETWEEN THE EXPERIENCING SELF AND THE REMEMBERING SELF FROM THE POINT OF VIEW THE EXPERIENCING SELF CLEARLY B HAD A WORST TIME
DanielKahneman_2010-0035446-0037132.wav NOW WHAT YOU COULD DO WITH PATIENT A AND WE ACTUALLY RAN CLINICAL EXPERIMENTS AND IT HAS BEEN DONE AND IT DOES WORK YOU COULD ACTUALLY EXTEND THE COLORNOSCOPY OF PATIENT A BY JUST KEEPING THE TUBE BEEN WITHOUT DRIGGLING IT TOO MUCH THAT WILL
DanielKahneman_2010-0037132-0038478.wav THAT WILL CAUSE THE PATIENT TO SUFFER BUT JUST A LITTLE AND MUCH LESS THAN BEFORE AND IF YOU DO THAT FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES YOU HAVE MADE THE EXPERIENCING SELF OF PATIENT A WORSE OFF
DanielKahneman_2010-0038478-0039174.wav AND YOU HAVE MADE THE REMEMBERING SELF OF PATIENT A LOT BETTER OFF BECAUSE NOW YOU HAVE ENDOWED PATIENT A
DanielKahneman_2010-0039174-0039589.wav WITH A BETTER STORY ABOUT HIS EXPERIENCE
DanielKahneman_2010-0039685-0039958.wav WHAT DEFINES A STORY
DanielKahneman_2010-0039958-0041769.wav AND THAT IS TRUE OF THE STORIES THAT MEMORY DELIVERS FOR US AND IT'S ALSO TRUE OF THE STORIES THAT WE MAKE UP AND WHEN DEFINES A STORY ARE CHANGES SIGNIFICANT MOMENTS AND ENDINGS ENDINGS ARE VERY VERY IMPORTANT AND IN THIS CASE YOU KNOW THE ENDING DOMINATED
DanielKahneman_2010-0041914-0042339.wav NOW THE EXPERIENCING SELF LIVES ITS LIFE
DanielKahneman_2010-0042339-0043310.wav CONTINUOUSLY IT HAS MOMENTS OF EXPERIENCE ONE AFTER THE OTHER AND YOU CAN ASK WHAT HAPPENS TO THESE MOMENTS AND THE ANSWER IS REALLY STRAIGHTFORWARD
DanielKahneman_2010-0043310-0044806.wav THEY ARE LOST FOREVER MEAN MOST OF THE MOMENTS OF OUR LIFE AND I CALCULATED YOU KNOW THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PRESENT IS SAID TO BE ABOUT THREE SECONDS LONG THAT MEANS THAT YOU KNOW AND IN A LIFE THEY ARE ABOUT SIX HUNDRED MILLION OF THEM IN A MONTH THERE ABOUT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND
DanielKahneman_2010-0044917-0045610.wav MOST OF THEM DON'T LEAVE A TRACE MOST OF THEM A COMPLETELY IGNORED BY THE REMEMBERING SELF
DanielKahneman_2010-0045610-0046008.wav AND YET SOMEHOW YOU GET THE SENSE THAT THEY SHOULD COUNT
DanielKahneman_2010-0046008-0046496.wav THAT WHAT HAPPENS DURING THESE MOMENTS OF EXPERIENCE IS OUR LIFE
DanielKahneman_2010-0046496-0046973.wav IT'S THE FINITE RESOURCE THAT WE'RE SPENDING WHILE WE ARE ON THIS EARTH
DanielKahneman_2010-0046973-0047905.wav AND HOW TO SPEND IT WOULD SEEM TO BE RELEVANT BUT THAT IS NOT THE STORY THAT OUR REMEMBERING SELF KEEPS FOR US SO WE HAVE THIS
DanielKahneman_2010-0047905-0048733.wav REMEMBERING SELF AND THE EXPERIENCING SELF AND THEY ARE REALLY QUITE DISTINCT THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM IS IN THE HANDLING OF TIME
DanielKahneman_2010-0048859-0049741.wav FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE EXPERIENCING SELF IF YOU HAVE A VACATION AND THE SECOND WEEK IS JUST AS GOOD AS THE FIRST THEN
DanielKahneman_2010-0049741-0050858.wav THE TWO WEAK VACATION IS TWICE AS GOOD AS THE ONE WEAK VACATION THAT SNUG THE WEIGHT WORKS AT ALL FOR THE REMEMBERING SELF FOR THE REMEMBERING SELF A TWO WEAK VACATION IS BARELY BETTER
DanielKahneman_2010-0050858-0051468.wav THAN THE ONE WEEK VACATION BECAUSE THERE ARE NO NEW MEMORIES ADDED YOU HAVE NOT TRAINED THE STORY
DanielKahneman_2010-0051468-0052833.wav AND IN THIS WAY TIME IS ACTUALLY THE CRITICAL VARIABLE THAT DISTINGUISHES I REMEMBERING SELF FROM HER EXPERIENCING SIR TIME HAS VERY LITTLE IMPACT ON THE STORY
DanielKahneman_2010-0052995-0053809.wav NOW THE REMEMBERING SELF DOES MORE THAN REMEMBER AND TELL STORIES IT IS ACTUALLY THE ONE THAT MAKES DECISIONS
DanielKahneman_2010-0053809-0054789.wav BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE A PATIENT WHO HAS HAD SAY TOO COLIN OSCOPES WITH TWO DIFFERENT SURGEONS AND IS DECIDING WHICH OF THEM TO CHOOSE THEN
DanielKahneman_2010-0054789-0055575.wav THE ONE THAT CHOOSES IS THE ONE THAT HAS IN OTHER MEMORY THAT IS LESS BAD AND THAT'S THE TRUTH THE SURGEON THAT WILL BE CHOSEN
DanielKahneman_2010-0055575-0056897.wav THE EXPERIENCING SELF HAS NO VOICE IN THIS CHOICE WE ACTUALLY DON'T CHOOSE BETWEEN EXPERIENCES WE CHOOSE BETWEEN MEMORIES OF EXPERIENCES AND EVEN WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE
DanielKahneman_2010-0056897-0057703.wav WE DON'T THINK OF OUR FUTURE NORMALLY AS EXPERIENCES WE THINK OF OUR FUTURE AS ANTICIPATED MEMORIES
DanielKahneman_2010-0057703-0058236.wav AND BEASTLY YOU CAN LOOK AT THIS UNITES A TYRANNY OF THE REMEMBERING SELF
DanielKahneman_2010-0058236-0059058.wav AND YOU CAN THINK ARE THE REMEMBERING SELF SORT OF DRAGGING THE EXPERIENCING SELF TO EXPERIENCES THAT THE EXPERIENCING SELF DOES A NEED
DanielKahneman_2010-0059058-0059728.wav I HAVE THAT SENSE THAT WHEN WE GO ONVOCATIONS THIS IS VERY FREQUENTLY THE CASE THAT IS THAT IT'S
DanielKahneman_2010-0059728-0060310.wav WE WE GO ON VACATIONS TO A VERY LARGE EXTENT IN THE SERVICE OF OUR REMEMBERING SELF
DanielKahneman_2010-0060408-0060748.wav AND THIS IS A BIT HOW TO DRESS THE FIRE THINKER IN A
DanielKahneman_2010-0060748-0061566.wav HOW MUCH DO WE CONSUME OUR MEMORIES THAT IS ONE OF THE EXPLANATION THAT IS GIVEN FOR THE DOMINANTS OF THE REMEMBERING SELF AN
DanielKahneman_2010-0061566-0062483.wav WHEN I THINK ABOUT THAT I THINK ABOUT AVOCATION WE HAD AN TALKTIC A FEW YEARS AGO WHICH WAS CLEARLY THE VESIFICATION OF EVER HAD AND I THINK OF IT RELATIVELY OFTEN
DanielKahneman_2010-0062483-0062883.wav RELATIVES TO HOW MUCH I THINK OF OTHER VACATIONS AND
DanielKahneman_2010-0062883-0064420.wav I'D PROBABLY HAVE CONSUMED MY MEMORIES OF THAT THREE WEEK TRIPS I WOULD SAY FOR ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MINUTES IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS NOW YOU KNOW IF I HAD EVER OPENED THE FOLDER WITH THE SIX HUNDRED PICTURES IN IT I WOULD HAVE SPENT ANOTHER HOUR
DanielKahneman_2010-0064420-0064847.wav NOW THAT IS THREE WEEKS AND THAT IS AT MOST AN HOUR AND A HALF
DanielKahneman_2010-0064847-0065787.wav THERE SEEMS TO BE A DISCREPANCY I MAY BE A BIT EXTREME IN OUR INHALED APPETITE I HAVE FOR CONSUMING MEMORIES BUT EVEN IF YOU DO MORE AVERSE
DanielKahneman_2010-0065787-0066105.wav THERE IS A GENUINE QUESTION
DanielKahneman_2010-0066105-0067307.wav WHY DO WE PUT SO MUCH WEIGHT ON MEMORY RELATIVE TO THE WEIGHT THAT WE PUT ON EXPERIENCES SO I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT
DanielKahneman_2010-0067307-0068102.wav IMAGINE THAT FOR YOUR NEXTIFICATION YOU KNOW THAT AT THE END OF THE BOOK THE VACATION ALL YOUR PICTURES WILL BE DESTROYED
DanielKahneman_2010-0068102-0068883.wav AND YOU'LL GET AN UNEASY GUG SO THAT YOU WON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING NOW WOULD YOU CHOOSE THE SAME VACATION
DanielKahneman_2010-0068883-0069413.wav AND AN IF AND IF YOU WOULD CHOOSE A DIFFERENT VACATION
DanielKahneman_2010-0069413-0070484.wav THERE IS A CONFLICT BETWEEN YOUR TWO SOULS AND YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO ADJUDICATE THE CONFLICT AND IT'S ACTUALLY ANOTHER AT ALL OBVIOUS BECAUSE IF YOU THINK IN TERMS OF TIME
DanielKahneman_2010-0070484-0071310.wav THEN YOU GET ONE ANSWER AND IF YOU THINK IN TERMS OF OF MEMORIES YOU MIGHT GET ANOTHER ANSWER
DanielKahneman_2010-0071310-0072107.wav WHY DO WE PICK THEM THE VACATIONS WE DO IS A PROBLEM THAT CONFRONTS US IN A WEATHER CHOICE BETWEEN THE TWO CELLS
DanielKahneman_2010-0072107-0073167.wav NOW THE TWO CELLS BRING UP TWO NOTIONS OF HAPPINESS THERE REALLY TO CONCEPTS OF HAPPINESS THAT WE CAN APPLY ONE HERSELF
DanielKahneman_2010-0073167-0074077.wav AND A SO YOU CAN ASK HOW HAPPY IS THE EXPERIENCING SELF AND THEN YOU WOULD ASK HOW HAPPY OF THE MOMENTS IN THE EXPERIENCING SELF'S LIFE
DanielKahneman_2010-0074077-0075091.wav AND THERE ARE HAPPINESS FOR MOMENTS AS A FAIRLY COMPLICATED PROCESS WHAT ARE THE EMOTIONS THAT CAN BE MEASURED AND BY THE WAY NOW WE ARE CAPABLE OF
DanielKahneman_2010-0075091-0075676.wav GETTING PRETTY GOOD IDEA OF THE HAPPINESS OF THE EXPERIENCING SELF OVER TIME
DanielKahneman_2010-0075859-0077361.wav IF YOU ASK FOR THE HAPPINESS OF THE REMEMBERING SELF IT'S A COMPLETED DIFFERENT THING THIS IS NOT ABOUT HOW HAPPILY A PERSON LIVES IT IS ABOUT HOW SATISFIED OR PLEASED THE PERSON IS WHEN THAT PERSON THINKS ABOUT HER LIFE
DanielKahneman_2010-0077361-0078381.wav VERY DIFFERENT NOTIONS ANY ONE WHO DOESN'T DISTINGUISH THOSE NOTIONS IS GOING TO MESS UP THE STUDY OF HAPPINESS AND I BELONG TO A CROWD OF STUDENTS OF WELL BEING
DanielKahneman_2010-0078381-0079856.wav WHO HAVE BEEN MISSING UP THE STUDY OF HAPPINESS FOR A LONG TIME IN PRECISELY THIS WAY THAT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE HAPPINESS OF THE EXPERIENCING SELF AND THE SATISFACTION OF THE REMEMBERING SELF HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED IN RECENT YEARS
DanielKahneman_2010-0079856-0081150.wav AND THERE ARE NOW EFFORTS TO MEASURE THE TWO SEPARATELY THE GALLOP ORGANIZATION HAS A WORLD POLE WITH MORE THAN HALF A MILLION PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THEY THINK OF THEIR LIFE AND ABOUT
DanielKahneman_2010-0081150-0082087.wav THEIR EXPERIENCES AND THERE THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER EFFORTS ALONG THOSE LINES SO IN RECENT YEARS WE HAVE BEGUN TO LEARN ABOUT THE HAPPINESS OF THE TWO CELLS
DanielKahneman_2010-0082087-0082668.wav AND THE MAIN LESSON I THINK THAT WE HAVE LEARNED IS THAT THEY ARE REALLY DIFFERENT
DanielKahneman_2010-0082668-0083634.wav YOU CAN KNOW HOW SATISFIED SOMEBODY IS WITH THEIR LIFE AND THAT REALLY DOESN'T TEACH YOU MUCH ABOUT HOW HAPPILY THEIR LIVING THEIR LIFE
DanielKahneman_2010-0083634-0084866.wav AND VICE VERSA YOU NOT JUST TO GIVE YOUR SENSE OF THE CORRELATION THE CORRELATION IS ABOUT POINT FIVE WITH THAT MEANS AS IF YOU MET SOMEBODY AND YOU WERE TOLD OR HIS FATHER IS SIX FEET TALL
DanielKahneman_2010-0084866-0085895.wav WOULD HOW MUCH WOULD YOU KNOW ABOUT HIS HEIGHT WELL YOU WOULD KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THIS HEIGHT BUT THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY YOU HAVE THAT MUCH UNCERTAINTY IF I TELL YOU THAT SOMEBODY
DanielKahneman_2010-0085895-0086702.wav RANK THEIR LIFE EIGHT ON A SCALE OF TEN YOU HAVE A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW HAPPY THEY ARE WITH THEIR EXPERIENCING SELF
DanielKahneman_2010-0086702-0088235.wav SO THE CORRELATION IS LOW WE KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT CONTROL SATISFACTION OF THE HAPPINESS SELF WE KNOW THAT MONEY IS VERY IMPORTANT GOLDS ARE VERY IMPORTANT WE KNOW THAT HAPPINESS IS MAINLY
DanielKahneman_2010-0088235-0088560.wav BEING SATISFIED WITH PEOPLE THAT WE LIKE
DanielKahneman_2010-0088560-0089669.wav SPENDING TIME WITH PEOPLE THAT WE LIKE THERE ARE OTHER PLEASURES BUT THIS IS DOMINANT SO IF YOU WANT TO MAXIMISE THE HAPPINESS OF THE TWO CELLS YOU ARE GOING TO END UP DOING VERY DIFFERENT THINGS
DanielKahneman_2010-0089669-0090768.wav THE BOTTOM LINE OF WHAT I SAID HERE IS THAT WE REALLY SHOULD NOT THINK OF HAPPINESS AH AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR WELL BEING IT IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT NOTION
DanielKahneman_2010-0090899-0091716.wav NOW VERY QUICKLY ANOTHER REASON WE CANNOT THINK STRAIGHT ABOUT HAPPINESS IS THAT
DanielKahneman_2010-0091927-0093025.wav WE DO NOT ATTEND THE CENT TO THE SAME THINGS WHEN WE THINK ABOUT LIFE AND WE ACTUALLY LIVE SO IF YOU ASK THE SIMPLE QUESTION OF HOW HAPPY PEOPLE ARE IN CALIFORNIA
DanielKahneman_2010-0093025-0094224.wav YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GET TO THE CORRECT ANSWER WHEN YOU ASK THAT QUESTION YOU THINK PEOPLE MUST BE HAPPIER IN CALIFORNIA IF IF SO YOU LIVE IN OHIO AH AND
DanielKahneman_2010-0094224-0095275.wav AND WHAT HAPPENS IS WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT LIVING IN CALIFORNIA YOU ARE THINKING OF THE CONTRAST BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND OTHER PLACES
DanielKahneman_2010-0095275-0096588.wav AND THAT CONTRAST SAYS IN CLIMATE WELL IT TURNS OUT THAT CLIMATE IS NOT VERY IMPORTANT TO THE EXPERIENCING SELF AND IS NOT EVEN VERY IMPORTANT TO THE REFLECT ITSELF THAT DECIDES OUR HAPPY PEOPLE ARE
DanielKahneman_2010-0096588-0097057.wav BUT NOW BECAUSE THE REFLECTIVE SELF IS IN CHARGE
DanielKahneman_2010-0097057-0098070.wav YOU MAY END UP SOME PEOPLE MAY END UP MOVING TO CALIFORNIA AND IT'S SORT OF INTERESTING TO TRACE WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO PEOPLE WHO MOVE TO CALIFORNIA IN THE HOPE OF GETTING HAPPIER
DanielKahneman_2010-0098070-0098558.wav WHILE THEIR EXPERIENCING SELF IS NOT GOING TO GET HAPPIER WE KNOW THAT
DanielKahneman_2010-0098714-0099039.wav BUT ONCE THEY WILL HAPPEN THEY WILL THINK THEY ARE HAPPIER
DanielKahneman_2010-0099039-0099822.wav BECAUSE WHEN THEY THINK ABOUT IT THEY'LL BE REMINDED OF HOW HORRIBLE THE WEATHER WAS IN OHIO
DanielKahneman_2010-0099822-0100627.wav AND THEY WILL FEEL THEY MADE THE RIGHT DECISION IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO THINK STRAIGHT ABOUT WELL BEING AN
DanielKahneman_2010-0100627-0101099.wav I HOPE I HAVE GIVEN YOU A SENSE OF HOW DIFFICULT IT IS THANK YOU
DanielKahneman_2010-0101553-0101804.wav OR HERE AS IN A FUSTITY
DanielKahneman_2010-0102006-0102484.wav THANK YOU SO MUCH NOW WHEN WE WERE ON THE PHONE NAM FEW WEEKS AGO AND
DanielKahneman_2010-0102484-0103049.wav YOU MENTIONED TO ME THAT THERE WAS QUITE AN INTERESTING RESULT CAME OUT OF THAT GALLOP SURVEY
DanielKahneman_2010-0103049-0103421.wav THAT IS THAT SUDDENLY THAT YOU CAN SHARE SINCE YOU DO HAVE A FEW MOMENTS LEFT NOW
DanielKahneman_2010-0103421-0104644.wav SURE AH I THINK THE MOST INTERESTING RESOLVE THAT WE FOUND IN THE GALLOPS OF IS A NUMBER WHICH WE ABSOLUTELY DID NOT EXPECT TO FIND WE FOUND OUT WITH RESPECT TO THE HAPPINESS OF THE EXPERIENCING SELF
DanielKahneman_2010-0104806-0105419.wav WHEN YOU KNOW WE LOOKED AT HOW INK OUR FEELINGS VERY WITHIN COME
DanielKahneman_2010-0105419-0106844.wav AND IT TURNS OUT THAT BELOW AN INCOME OF SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR AMERICANS AND THAT'S A VERY LARGE SAMPLE OF AMERICANS LIKE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND SO THAT SIR LAUD REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE BELOW AN INCOME OF SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR
DanielKahneman_2010-0106844-0106939.wav SIXTY THOUSANDS
DanielKahneman_2010-0106939-0107048.wav THOUSAND
DanielKahneman_2010-0107272-0108616.wav SIXTY THOUSAND SIX SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR PEOPLE ARE UNHAPPY AND THEY GET PROGRESSIVELY UNHAPPY OF THE POORER VIGATE ABOVE THAT WE GET AN ABSOLUTELY FLAT LINE I MEAN I'VE REALLY SEEN LINE SO FLAT
DanielKahneman_2010-0108616-0109448.wav CLEARLY WHAT IS HAPPENING IS MONEY DOES NOT BUY YOUR EXPERIENTIAL HAPPINESS BUT LACK OF MONEY CERTAINLY BY YOUR MISERY
DanielKahneman_2010-0109448-0109936.wav AND WE CAN MEASURE THAT MISERY VERY VERY CLEARLY IN TERMS OF THIS
DanielKahneman_2010-0109936-0110809.wav THE OTHER SELF REMEMBERING SELF YOU GET A DIFFERENT STORY THE MORE MONEY YOU ARE THE MOST SATISFIED YOU ARE THAT DOES NOT HOLD FOR EMOTION
DanielKahneman_2010-0110809-0111390.wav BUT DUNNABY THE YOUNG WHOLE AMERICAN ENDEAVOR IS ABOUT IN A LIFE LIBERTY THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS
DanielKahneman_2010-0111501-0112274.wav IF PEOPLE TOOK SERIOUSLY THAT FINDING AND IT SEEMS TO TURN UPSIDE DOWN EVERYTHING WE BELIEVE ABOUT
DanielKahneman_2010-0112274-0113273.wav DENOMIC FOR EXAMPLE TAXATION POLICY AND SO FORTH IS IT ONLY CHANCE THAT POLITICIANS THAT THE COUNTRY GENERALLY WOULD TAKE A FINDING LIKE THAT SERIOUSLY AND RUN PUBLIC POLICY BASED ON IT
DanielKahneman_2010-0113273-0114682.wav AND I THINK THAT THERE IS RECOGNITION OF THE RULE OF HAPPINESS RESEARCHE IN PUBLIC POLICY THE RECOGNITION IS GOING TO BE SLOW IN THE UNITED STATES NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT BUT IN THE U K IT IS HAPPENING AND IN OTHER COUNTRIES THAT IS HAPPENING
DanielKahneman_2010-0114682-0115296.wav PEOPLE ARE RECOGNIZING THAT THEY OUGHT TO BE THINKING OF POLICY WHEN OF HAPPINESS WHEN THEY THINK OF PUBLIC POLICY
DanielKahneman_2010-0115368-0116755.wav IT'S GOING TO TAKE A WHILE AND IT'S NOT GOING TO AND PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DEBATE WHETHER THEY WANT TO STUDY EXPERIENCE HAPPINESS OR WHETHER THEY WANT TO STUDY LIFE IN VALUATION SO WE NEED TO HAVE THAT DEBATE FAIRLY SOON HOW TO ENHANCE HAPPINESS
DanielKahneman_2010-0116755-0118016.wav GOES VERY DIFFERENT WAYS DEPENDING AND HOW YOU THINK AND WHETHER YOU THINK OF THE REMEMBERING SELF OR YOU THINK OF THE EXPERIENCING SELF THIS IS GOING TO INFLUENCE POLICY I THINK IN YEARS TO COME IN THE UNITED STATES EFFORTS ARE BEING MADE
DanielKahneman_2010-0118016-0118829.wav TO MEASURE THE EXPERIENCED HAPPINESS OF THE POPULATION THIS IS GOING TO BE I THINK WITHIN THE NEXT DECADO TO PART OF NATIONAL STATISTICS
DanielKahneman_2010-0118829-0119225.wav WELL IT SEEMS TO THAT THIS ISSUE WELL ORNEY SHOULD BE
DanielKahneman_2010-0119225-0119831.wav THE MOST INTERESTING POLICY DISCUSSION TO TRACK OVER THE NEXT FEARS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR INVENTING BEHAVIOUR HE COMES
DanielKahneman_2010-0119831-0119944.wav FACT IS ANY COND
EricMead_2009P-0001843-0003166.wav FOR SOME TIME I HAVE BEEN INTERESTED IN THE PLACEIBO EFFECT WHICH MIGHT SEEM LIKE AN ODD THING FOR A MAGICIAN TO BE INTERESTED IN UNLESS YOU THINK OF IT IN THE TERMS THAT I DO WHICH IS A SOMETHING FAKE
EricMead_2009P-0003166-0004567.wav IS BELIEVED IN ENOUGH BY SOMEBODY THAT IT BECOMES SOMETHING REAL IN OTHER WORDS SUGAR PILLS HAVE A MEASURABLE EFFECT IN CERTAIN KINDS OF STUDIES AH THE POSSEBO EFFECT JUST BECAUSE THE PERSON THINKS
EricMead_2009P-0004567-0006338.wav THAT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THEM IS A FARM A SUITICAL OR A M SOME SORT OF AA FOR PAIN MANAGEMENT FOR EXAMPLE IF THEY BELIEVE IT ENOUGH THERE'S A MEASURABLE EFFECT IN THE BODY CALLED THE POSSEBO EFFECT SOMETHING FAKE BECOMES SOMETHING REAL BECAUSE OF SOMEONE'S PERCEPTION OF IT
EricMead_2009P-0006338-0008004.wav AH IN ORDER FOR US TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER I ONCE START BY SHOWING YOU A RUDIMENTARY VERY SIMPLE MAGIC TRICK AND I SHOW YOU HOW IT WORKS THE SUTRIC THAT'S BEEN IN EVERY CHILDREN'S MAGIC BOOK SINCE AT LEAST THE NINETEEN FIFTIES AH I LEARNED MYSELF FROM CUB SCOUT MAGIC IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES
EricMead_2009P-0008004-0008997.wav I'LL DO FOR YOU AND THEN I'LL EXPLAIN IT AND THEN I'LL EXPLAIN WHY I EXPLAINED IT CAX SO I HEARS IT HAPPENS THE KNIFE WHICH YOU COULD EXAMINE MY HAND WHICH YOU COULD EXAMINE
EricMead_2009P-0008997-0009949.wav I SNOW HOLD THE KNIFE IN MY FISTS LIKE THIS I DIDN'T I'LL GET MY SLEEVE BACK AND OUGHT TO MAKE SURE NOTHING GOES UP OR DOWN MY SLEEVE I'M JUST GOING TO SQUEEZE MY WRIST RIGHT HERE I
EricMead_2009P-0009949-0010780.wav THAT WAY YOU CAN SEE THAT AT NO TIME CAN ANYTHING TRAVEL AS LONG AS I AM SQUEEZING THERE NOTHING CAN GO UP OR DOWN MY SLEEVE AND THE OBJECT OF THIS IS QUITE SIMPLE
EricMead_2009P-0010870-0011388.wav AH I'M GOING TO OPEN MY HAND AND HOPEFULLY IF ALL IS WELL
EricMead_2009P-0011408-0012109.wav MY PURE ANIMAL MAGNETISM WILL HOLD THE KNIFE IN FACT ITS HELD SO TIGHTLY IN PLACE THAT I CAN SHAKE IT

EricMead_2009P-0013346-0014883.wav SO THIS THE TRICK THAT I OFTEN TEACH TO YOUNG CHILDREN THAT ARE INTERESTED IN MAGIC BECAUSE YOU CAN LEARN A GREAT DEAL ABOUT DECEPTION BY STUDYING THIS VERY EVEN THOSE A VERY SIMPLE TRICK METHOD LOGICALLY PROBABLY MANY OF YOU IN THE ROOM KNOW THIS TRICK AH WHAT HAPPENS IS THIS I HOLD THE KNIFE IN MY HAND
EricMead_2009P-0014883-0015996.wav I SAY I'M GOING TO GRAB HOLD OF MY WRIST TO MAKE FOR NOTHING GOES UP OR DOWN MY SLEEVE THAT IS A LIE THE REASON I'M HOLDING ON TO MY WRIST IS BECAUSE THAT'S ACTUALLY THE SECRET

EricMead_2009P-0020001-0020775.wav CHICANERY MY INEX FINGER BEING THERE AND THEN WHEN I CLOSED MY FINGER SAME THING AS I MOVE BACK

EricMead_2009P-0022286-0023119.wav I READ A STUDY AH A YEAR SO AGO THAT REALLY BLEW MY MIND WIDE OPEN I'M NOT A DOCTOR A RESEARCHER SO THIS TO ME WAS AN ASTONISHING THING
EricMead_2009P-0023119-0025228.wav TURNS OUT THAT IF YOU ADMINISTER A POSSEBO IN THE FORM OF A WHITE PILL THAT'S LIKE A ASPRING SHAPED JUST A ROUND WHITE PILL IT HAS SOME CERTAIN MEASURABLE EFFECT BUT IF YOU CHANGE THE FORM THAT YOU GIVE THE POSSEBO IN LIKE YOU MAKE A SMALLER PILL AND COLOR IT BLUE AND STAMP A LETTER INTO IT IT IS ACTUALLY MEASURABLY MORE EFFECTIVE
EricMead_2009P-0025228-0026154.wav EVEN THOUGH NEITHER ONE OF THESE THINGS HAS IN ANY FARMER SUITABLE QUITE THEIR SUGAR PILLS BUT A WHITE PILL IS NOT AS GOOD AS A BLUE PILL THE LITTLE GIRL WHAT
EricMead_2009P-0026202-0026914.wav THAT REALLY FLIT ME OUT TURNS OUT THOUGH THAT'S NOT EVEN WHERE IT STOPS IF YOU UM HAVE CAPSULES
EricMead_2009P-0026914-0028352.wav THEIR MORE EFFECTIVE THAN TABLETS IN ANY FORM A COLOURED CAPSULE THAT YELLOW ON ONE END AND RED ON THE OTHER IS BETTER THAN A WHITE CAPSLE DOSAGE HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THIS YOU KNOW ONE PILL TWICE A DAY IS NOT AS GOOD AS THREE PILLS
EricMead_2009P-0028352-0028677.wav I DON'T REMEMBER THIS DISTANCE BUT THE POINT IS
EricMead_2009P-0028883-0029617.wav THESE DOSEAGES HAVE SOME DEGREE WITH IT AND THE FORM HAS SOME BIGGER AND IF YOU WANT THE ULTIMATE IN A PLACEBO YOU'LL GO TO THE NEEDLE

EricMead_2009P-0031463-0032676.wav THE WHITE PILL IS NOT AS GOOD AS THE BLUE PILL IS NOT AS GOOD AS THE CAPSULE IS NOT AS GOOD AS THE NEEDLE AND NONE OF IT HAS ANY REAL A FARM A SUITICAL QUALITY ITS ONLY YOUR BELIEF THAT MAKES IT REAL
EricMead_2009P-0032676-0034050.wav IN YOUR BODY AND MAKES A STRONGER EFFECT I WANTED TO SEE IF I COULD TAKE THAT IDEA AND APPLY IT TO A MAGIC TRICK AND TAKE SOMETHING THAT IS OBVIOUSLY A FAKE TRICK AND MAKE IT SEEM REAL
EricMead_2009P-0034369-0035504.wav AND WE KNOW FROM THAT STUDY THAT WHEN YOU WANT REALITY YOU GO TO THE NEEDLE THIS IS A SEVEN INCH HAT PIN ITS VERY VERY SHARP
EricMead_2009P-0035504-0036061.wav AND I I'M GOING TO JUST STARE ALIZE AT A TINY BIT GOING

EricMead_2009P-0044329-0044521.wav SAW ME GIVE YOU LITTLE PEAK
EricMead_2009P-0044613-0044815.wav HAS THAT LOOK OUT THERE PRETTY GOOD
EricMead_2009P-0045043-0045125.wav I DON'T

EricMead_2009P-0047040-0047574.wav GIGGLE IN THE BACK OR PEOPLE ON FIDIO YEARS OR NOW WATCHING THIS AGO YET THAT LOOKS KIND OF NEAT AND
EricMead_2009P-0047574-0048181.wav SOME SORT OF EFFECT THERE BUT IF IT WERE REAL HE WOULD BE SEEN AS THE WHOLE THERE IN A HOLE THERE IF IT WERE REAL HE WOULD BE BLEEDING
EricMead_2009P-0048181-0048374.wav I'LL ME WORK UP SOME BLOOD FOR YOU
EricMead_2009P-0048831-0049097.wav
EricMead_2009P-0051216-0052077.wav NORMALLY NOW I WOULD TAKE TO NEEDLE OUT I WOULD CLEAN OFF MY ARM AND I WOULD SHOW YOU THAT THERE ARE NO WOUNDS BUT I THINK IN THIS CONTEXT AND WITH THE IDEA OF
EricMead_2009P-0052077-0052750.wav TAKING SOMETHING FAKE AND MAKING IT INTO SOMETHING REAL I JUST GOING TO LEAVE IT THERE AND WALK OFF THE STAGE
EricMead_2009P-0053024-0053644.wav I WILL BE SEEING YOU SEVERAL TIMES OF THE NEXT FEW DAYS I HOPE YOU ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT THANK YOUR MAMMA
GaryFlake_2010-0001605-0002712.wav IF I CAN LEAVE YOU WITH ONE BIG IDEA TO DAY IT'S THAT THE WHOLE OF THE DATA IN WHICH WE CONSUME IS GREATER THAN THE SUM OF THE PARTS AND INSTEAD OF THINKING ABOUT INFORMATION OVERLOAD
GaryFlake_2010-0002712-0004072.wav WHAT I'D LIKE YOU TO THINK ABOUT IS HOW WE CAN USE INFORMATION TO THAT PATTERN'S POP AND WE CAN SEE TRINS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE INVISIBLE SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT RIGHT HERE IS A TYPICAL MORTALITY CHART ORGANIZED BY AGE THIS
GaryFlake_2010-0004072-0005245.wav TRUE THAT AMUSING HERE IS A LITTLE EXPERIMENT THAT'S CALLED PIVOT AND WITH PIVOT WHAT I CAN DO IS I CAN CHOOSE TO FILTER ON ONE PARTICULAR CAUSE OF DEBT SAY ACCIDENTS AND RIGHT AWAY I SEE THERE'S A DIFFERENT PATTERN THAT EMERGES
GaryFlake_2010-0005245-0006253.wav THIS IS BECAUSE IN THE MID ERA HERE PEOPLE ARE THEIR MOST ACTIVE AND OVERHEAR THEIR MOST FRAIL WE CAN STEP BACK OUT AGAIN AND THEN REORGANIZE THE DATE OF BY CAUSE OF DEATH
GaryFlake_2010-0006253-0007070.wav SEEING THAT CIRCULARATORY DISEASES AND CANCERS OF THE USUAL SUSPECTS BUT NOT FOR EVERY ONE IF WE GO AHEAD AND WE FILLED HER
GaryFlake_2010-0007070-0007797.wav BY AGE SAY FORTY YEARS OR LESS WE SEE THAT ACCIDENTS ARE ACTUALLY THE GREATEST CAUSE THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO BE WORRIED ABOUT
GaryFlake_2010-0007797-0008762.wav AND WE DRONED TO THAT IT'S ESPECIALLY THE CASE FOR MAT SO YOU GET THE IDEA THAT VIEWING INFORMATION VIEWING DATE IN THIS WAY IS A LOT LIKE
GaryFlake_2010-0008762-0009589.wav SWIMMING IN AN LIVING INFORMATION INHOGRAPHIC AND IF WE CAN DO THIS FOR RAW DATA WHY NOT DO IT FOR CONTENT AS WELL
GaryFlake_2010-0009589-0010306.wav SO WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT HERE IS THE COVER OF EVERY SINGLE SPORT ILLUSTRATED EVER PRODUCED
GaryFlake_2010-0010306-0011591.wav IT'S ALL HERE IT'S ALL IN THE WEB YOU CAN GO BACK YOUR ROOMS AND TRY THIS AFTER MY TALK WITH PIVOT YOU CAN DRILL INTO A DECADE YOU CAN DRILL INTO A PARTICULAR YEAR YOU CAN JUMP RIGHT INTO A SPECIFIC ISSUE
GaryFlake_2010-0011591-0012755.wav SO ON LOOKING AT THIS I SEE THE ATHLETES THAT HAVE APPEARED IN THIS ISSUE THE SPORTS ON A LAND'S ARMSTRONG FAN SO I'LL GO AHEAD IN ON CLICK ON THAT WHICH REVEALS FOR ME ALL THE ISSUES IN WHICH LAND'S ARMSTRONGS BEEN APART OF
GaryFlake_2010-0013068-0014141.wav NOW IF I WANTED JUST KIND OF TAKE A PIQUE AT THESE I MIGHT THINK WELL WHAT ABOUT TAKING LOOK AT ALL OF CYCLING SO I CAN STEP BACK AND EXPAND ON THAT I SEE GREGG LA MON NOW
GaryFlake_2010-0014141-0015469.wav AND SO YOU GET THE IDEA THAT WHEN YOU NAVIGATE OVER INFORMATION THIS WAY GOING NARROW BROADER BACKING AND BACKING OUT YOU'RE NOT SEARCHING YOU'RE NOT BROWSING YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING THAT'S ACTUALLY A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT IT'S IN BETWEEN HIM
GaryFlake_2010-0015469-0018126.wav WE THINK IT CHANGES THE WAY INFORMATION CAN BE USED SO ON AN EXTRAPULATE ON THIS IDEA BENT WITH SOMETHING OF THE LITTLE A CRAZY WHAT WE'VE DONE HERE IS WE'VE TAKEN EVERY SINGLE WICKPEEDIA PAGE AND WE REDUCED IT DOWN TO A LITTLE SUMMARY SO THE SUMMARY CONSISTS OF JUST LITTLE SYNOPSIS AND THE ICON TO INDICATE THE TOPICAL AIRY THAT IT COMES FROM I'M ONLY SHOWING THE TOP FIVE HUNDRED MOST POPULAR WICKAPETIA PAGES STRAIGHT HERE EVEN IN THIS OMNISTIC VIEW
GaryFlake_2010-0018126-0018976.wav WE CAN DO A LOT OF THINGS RIGHT AWAY WE GET A SENSE OF WHAT ARE THE TOPICAL DOMAINS THAT ARE MOST POPULAR IN WICKAPPAEDIA I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD IN SLIGHT GOVERNMENT
GaryFlake_2010-0018976-0019895.wav NOW HAVING SELECTED GOVERNMENT I CAN NOW SEE THAT THE WICKAPEDIA CATEGORIES THAT WAS FREQUENTLY CORRESPOND TO THAT OUR TIME MAGAZINE PEOPLE OF THE YEAR
GaryFlake_2010-0019895-0021557.wav SO THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THIS IS AN INSIGHT THAT WAS NOT CONTAINED WITHIN ANY ONE WICKPEEDIA PAGE IT'S ONLY POSSIBLE TO SEE THAT INSIGHT WHEN HE STEP BACK AND LOOK AT ALL OF THEM LOOKING AT ONE OF THESE PARTICULAR SUMMARIES I CAN THEN DRILL INTO THE CONCEPT OF
GaryFlake_2010-0021557-0022461.wav TIME MAGAZINE PERSON OF THE YEAR BRINGING UP ALL OF THEM SO LOOKING AT THESE FEEBLE I CAN SEE THAT THE MAJORITY COME FROM GOVERNMENT
GaryFlake_2010-0022461-0022945.wav SOME HAVE COME FROM NATURAL SCIENCES
GaryFlake_2010-0022945-0023252.wav SOME FEWER STILL HAVE COME FROM BUSINESS
GaryFlake_2010-0023317-0023585.wav THERE'S MY BOSS AND A
GaryFlake_2010-0023711-0023977.wav ONE HAS COME FROM MUSIC
GaryFlake_2010-0024060-0024501.wav AND INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH BONNO WAS ALSO TEN PRIZE WINNER
GaryFlake_2010-0024501-0025648.wav SO WE CAN GO JUMP AND TAKE A LOOK AT ALL TEN PRIZE WINNERS CECY WE'RE NAVIGATING THE WEB FOR THE FIRST TIME AS IF IT'S ACTUALLY A WEB NOT FROM PAGE TO PAGE BUT AT A HIGHER LEVEL OF ABSTRACTION
GaryFlake_2010-0025648-0026888.wav AND SO I WANT TO SHOW YOU ONE OTHER THING THAT MAY CATCH A LITTLE OF IT BY SURPRISE I'M JUST SHOWING THE NEARER TIMES WEBSITE HERE SO PIVOT THIS APPLICATION I DON'T WANT TO CALL TO BROWSERS REALLY NOT A BROWSER
GaryFlake_2010-0026888-0027889.wav BUT YOU CAN VIEW WHAT PAGES WITH IT AND WE BRING THAT SUMABLE TECHNOLOGY TO EVERY SINGLE WET PAGE LIKE THIS SO I CAN STEP BACK
GaryFlake_2010-0027889-0029249.wav PAPA WRITE BACK INTO A SPECIFIC SECTION NOW THE REASON WHY THIS IS IMPORTANCE BECAUSE BY VIRTUE OF JUST VIEWING WEB PAGES IN THIS WAY I CAN LOOK IT IN MY ENTIRE BROWSING HISTORY IN THE EXACT SAME WAY SO I CAN DRILL IN TO WHAT I'VE DONE
GaryFlake_2010-0029249-0030180.wav OVER SPECIFIC TIME FRAMES HERE IN FACT IS THE STATE OF ALL THE DEMO THAT I JUST GAVE AND I CAN SORT OF REPLACE HIMSELF THAT I WAS LOOKING AT EARLIER TO DAY
GaryFlake_2010-0030180-0030858.wav AND IF I WANT A STEP BACK AND LOOK AT EVERYTHING I CAN SLICE INDISE MY HISTORY PERHAPS BY MY SEARCH HISTORY
GaryFlake_2010-0030858-0031869.wav HERE IS DOING SOME NEPATISTIC SEARCHING LOOKING FOR BEING OVER HERE FOR LIVE LAPSED PIVOT AND FROM THESE I CAN DRILL INTO THE WEB PAYS AND JUST LAUNCH THEM AGAIN IT'S ONE MATTER FOR
GaryFlake_2010-0031869-0032556.wav REPURP IS MULTIPLE TIMES AND IN EACH CASE IT MAKES THE WHOLE GREATER THAN THE SUM OF THE PARTS WITH THE DATA SO

GaryFlake_2010-0033425-0033991.wav DROWNING IN DATA WHAT IF WE CAN ACTUALLY TURN THAT UPSIDE DOWN AND TURN THE WEB UPSIDE DOWN
GaryFlake_2010-0033991-0035282.wav SO THAT INSTEAD OF NAVIGATING FROM ONE THING TO THE NEXT WE GET USED TO THE HABIT OF BEING ABLE TO GO FROM MANY THINGS TO MANY THINGS AND THEN BEING ABLE TO SEE THE PATTERNS THAT WERE OTHERWISE HID IT IF WE CAN DO THAT THEN INSTEAD
GaryFlake_2010-0035282-0036714.wav OF BEING TRACT AND DATA WE MIGHT ACTUALLY EXTRACT INFORMATION AND INSTEAD OF FEELING JUST WITH INFORMATION WE CAN TEASE OUT KNOWLEDGE AND IF WE GET THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE MAY BE THESE FROM THEIRS WISDOM TO BE FOUND SO THAT I THANK YOU
JamesCameron_2010-0001675-0002796.wav I GREW UP ON STEADY DIET OF SCIENCE FICTION IN HIGH SCHOOL I TOOK A BUST OF SCHOOL AN HOUR EACH WAY EVERY DAY AND A I WAS ALWAYS ABSORBED IN A BOOK
JamesCameron_2010-0002796-0004181.wav SCIENCE FICTION BOOK WHICH TOOK MY MIND TO OTHER WORLDS AND SATISFIED THIS AH IN ENNA IN A NARRATIVE FORM THIS INSATIABLE SENSE OF CURIOSITY THAT I HAD AN AND A
JamesCameron_2010-0004181-0004572.wav IN ORLETTRIOSITY ALSO MANIFESTED ITSELF AND IN THEM

JamesCameron_2010-0006248-0007081.wav UNDERSTAND THE WORLD UNDERSTAND THE LIMITS OF OF POSSIBILITY AND MY LOVE OF SCIENCE FICTION
JamesCameron_2010-0007081-0007718.wav ACTUALLY SEEMED TO BE MIRRORED IN THE WORLD AROUND ME BECAUSE WHAT WAS HAPPENING THIS WAS IN THE LATE SIXTIES
JamesCameron_2010-0007718-0009147.wav AH IN ALL WE WERE WE WERE GOING TO THE MOON WE WERE EXPLORING THE DEPOTIONS A JACQUES CRISTO WAS COMING INTO OUR LIVING ROOMS WITH HIS AMAZING SPECIALS THAT SHOWED US ANIMALS AND PLACES IN THE ILL WONDROUS WORLD THAT WE COULD NEVER REALLY HAVE
JamesCameron_2010-0009147-0009668.wav PREVIOUSLY IMAGINED SO THAT SEEMED TO RESINATE WITH THE WHOLE SCIENCE FICTION PART OF IT
JamesCameron_2010-0009668-0011129.wav AND I WAS A AN ARTIST I COULD DRAW A PAINT AND I I FOUND THAT BECAUSE THERE WEREN'T IN ALL VIDIO GAMES AND THE SATURATION OF SIEGEY MOVIES AND ALL OF THIS IMAGERY IN THE MEDIAL LANDSCAPE
JamesCameron_2010-0011129-0012357.wav I HAD TO CREATE THESE IMAGES OF MY HEAD ON YOU DON'T WE ALL DID AS KIDS HAVING TO A READER BOOK AND THROUGH THE AUTHOR'S DESCRIPTION PUT SOMETHING ON THE ON THE SCREEN THE ER THE MOVIE SCREEN IN OUR HEADS AND SO MY
JamesCameron_2010-0012357-0013647.wav RESPONSE TO THIS WAS TO PAINT TO DRAW ALIEN CREATURE'S ALIEN WORLD'S ROBOTS SPACESHIPS ALL THAT STUFF I WAS ENDLESSLY GETTING BUSTED IN MOUTH CLASPED IN A DOODLING BEHIND THE BEHIND THE TEXT BOOK AND
JamesCameron_2010-0013647-0014515.wav THAT WAS THEIR CREATTIVITY HAD TO HAD TO FIND ITS OUTLET SOMEHOW AND AN INTERESTING THING HAPPENED THAT THE JACQUES CUSTO
JamesCameron_2010-0014515-0015778.wav SHOWS AH NOW SHE GOT ME VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE FACT THAT THERE WAS AN ALIEN WORLD RIGHT HERE ON EARTH I MIGHT NOT REALLY GO TO AN ALIEN WORLD ON A SPACESHIP SOME DAY OH THAT THAT SEEMED PRETTY ON PRETTY DARNED UNLIKELY
JamesCameron_2010-0015778-0016681.wav BUT I COULD THAT WAS A WORLD I COULD REALLY GO TO RIGHT HERE ON EARTH THAT WAS AS RICH AND EXOTIC AS ANYTHING THAT I HAD IMAGINED AH FROM READING THESE BOOKS
JamesCameron_2010-0016681-0017803.wav SO AH I DECIDED I WAS GOING TO BECOME A SKUAD DIVER AT THE AGE OF FIFTEEN AND THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THAT WAS THAT I LIVED IN A LITTLE VILLAGE IN CANADA SIX HUNDRED MILES FROM THE NEAREST OCEAN
JamesCameron_2010-0017803-0018791.wav BUT I DIDN'T LET THAT DAUNT ME AH I PESTERED MY FATHER UNTIL HE FINALLY FOUND A A SCOOP OF CLASSING IN A BUFFALO NEW YORK READ ACROSS THE BORDER FROM WHERE WE LIVE
JamesCameron_2010-0018791-0019437.wav THEN I ACTUALLY GOT CERTIFIED AH IN A POOL AT A WY M C A IN THE DEAD OF WINTER IN BUFFALO NEW YORK AND
JamesCameron_2010-0019437-0020430.wav I DIDN'T SEE THE OCEAN A A REAL OCEAN FOR ANOTHER TWO YEARS UNTIL WE THOUGH WE MOVED TO CALIFORNIA AND NOW SINCE THEN IN ON THE IN THE INTERVENING
JamesCameron_2010-0020430-0021481.wav FORTY YEARS AH I'VE I'VE SPENT ABOUT THREE THOUSAND HOURS UNDER WATER AND FIVE HUNDRED HOURS OF THAT WAS INSUBMERCIBLES AND I'VE LEARNED THAT
JamesCameron_2010-0021481-0022229.wav THAT THAT DEEP OCEAN ENVIRONMENT AND EVEN THE SHALLOW OCEANS ARE SO A RICH AND WITH A WITH AMAZING LIFE
JamesCameron_2010-0022229-0022873.wav THERE REALLY IS BEYOND BEYOND OUR IMAGINATION IN NATURE'S IMAGINATION IS SO
JamesCameron_2010-0022873-0024014.wav SO BOUNDLESS COMPARED TO OUR OWN A MEAGRE HUMAN IMAGINATION I STILL TO THIS DATE STAND IN ABSOLUTE AWE OF WHAT I WHAT I SEE WHEN I MAKE THESE DIVES AND MY LOVE AFFAIR WITH THE OCEAN IS
JamesCameron_2010-0024014-0024754.wav IS ON GOING AND JUST AS STRONG AS IT EVER WAS BUT TO ONE NIGHT WHEN I CHOSE PRAYER AS AN ADULT TUB
JamesCameron_2010-0024754-0025256.wav IT WAS PHIL MAKING AND THAT SEEMED TO BE THE BEST WAY TO RECONCILE
JamesCameron_2010-0025256-0026705.wav THIS URGE I HAD TO TELL STORIES WITH MY MY URGES TO A TRADE IMAGES AND I WAS AS A KID CONSTANTLY DRAWN COMIC BOOKS AND SAW IT SO PHIL MAKING WAS THE WAY TO PUT PICTURES AND STORIES TOGETHER AND THAT MADE SENSE AND OF COURSE THE STORIES IT
JamesCameron_2010-0026705-0027848.wav I CHOSE TO TELL WHERE SCIENCE FICTION STORIES TERMINATOR ALIENS THEN THE ABYSS AND WITH THE ABYSS AH I WAS PUTTING TOGETHER MY LOVE OF UNDERWATER AND DIVING WITH FILM MAKING SO YOUNG
JamesCameron_2010-0027848-0028533.wav MERGING THE TWO PASSIONS SOMETHING INTERESTING CAME OUT OF THE ABYSS WHICH WAS
JamesCameron_2010-0028533-0029382.wav THAT TO SOLVE A SPECIFIC NARRATIVE PROBLEM ON THAT FILM WHICH WAS TO CREATE THIS KIND OF LIQUID WATER CREATURE
JamesCameron_2010-0029382-0030136.wav AH WE ACTUALLY EMBRACED A COMPUTER A GENERATED ANIMATION ACIJI AND
JamesCameron_2010-0030136-0031025.wav THIS A THIS RESULTED IN THE FIRST SOFT SURFACE CHARACTER SIEGEIANIMATION THAT WAS EVER IN HIM IN A MOVING
JamesCameron_2010-0031025-0032997.wav AND EVEN THE FILM DID MAKE ANY MONEY OH BARELY BROKE EVEN I SHOULD SAY I WITNESS SOMETHING AMAZING WHICH IS THAT THE AUDIENCE THE GLOBAL AUDIENCE WAS MESMERIZED BY THIS APPARENT MAGIC YOU KNOW ITS ARTHUR CLARK'S LAW THAN ANY SUFFICIENTLY ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY IS INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM MAGIC THEY WERE SEEING SOMETHING MAGICAL
JamesCameron_2010-0032997-0034378.wav AND SO THAT THAT THAT GOT ME VERY EXCITED I THOUGHT WHILE THIS IS THIS IS SOMETHING IN NEEDS TO BE EMBRACED INTO THE CINEMATIC ART SO WITH THE TERMINATOR TO WHICH WAS MY NEXT FILM WE TOOK THAT MUCH FARTHER WORKING WITH ILEM WE CREATED THE LIQUID METAL
JamesCameron_2010-0034378-0035683.wav DUDE IN THAT FILM THAT SUCCESS HUNG IN THE BALANCE ON WHETHER THAT EFFECT WOULD WORK AND IT DID AND WE CREATED MAGIC AGAIN AND WE HAD THE SAME RESULT ON WITH AN AUDIENCE ALTHOUGH WE DID MAKE A LITTLE MORE MONEY ON THAT WAY AH SO
JamesCameron_2010-0035683-0036761.wav NOW DRY LINE THROUGH THOSE OF THOSE TWO DOTS OF EXPERIENCE CAME TO THIS THIS IS GOING TO BE A WHOLE NEW WORLD THIS IS A WHOLE NEW WORLD OF CRETIVITY FOR
JamesCameron_2010-0036761-0037793.wav FOR FILM ARTISTS SO I I STARTED A COMPANY WITH STAND WENSTON MY GOOD FRIEND SAM WINSTON WHO IS A THE PREMIER MAKE UP AND IN CREATURE DESIGNER
JamesCameron_2010-0037793-0039422.wav AH AT THAT TIME AND IT WAS CALLEDDIGITAL DOMAIN AND THE CONCEPT OF THE COMPANY WAS THAT WE WOULD LEAP FROG PAST THE KIND OF ANALOGUE PROCESSES OF OPTICAL PRINTERS AND SONG AND WE WOULD GO RIGHT TO DIGITAL PRODUCTION AND WE OUGHT SHE DID THAT AND GAVE US A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE FOR A WHILE
JamesCameron_2010-0039422-0040288.wav BUT WE FOUND OURSELVES LAGGING IN IN THE MIDNIGHTIES IN THE CREATURE AND CHARACTER DESIGN STUFF THAT WE HAD ACTUALLY FOUNDED THE COMPANY TO DO
JamesCameron_2010-0040288-0040961.wav SO I WROTE THIS PIECE CALLED AVATAR WHICH WAS MEANT TO ABSOLUTELY PUSH THE ENVELOPE
JamesCameron_2010-0040961-0042394.wav OF VISUAL EFFECTS OF C G EFFECTS BEYOND WITH REALISTIC A HUMAN IMMODIVE A CHARACTERS GENERATED IN C G IN THE MAIN CHARACTERS AT ALL BE ASSYGIE AND THE WORLD WOULD BE IN SIEGEI AND A
JamesCameron_2010-0042394-0043693.wav NOW THAT THE ENVELOPE PUSHED BACK AND I WAS TOLD BY A LIP THE FOLKS AT MY COMPANY THAT WE WEREN'T GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS FOR A WHILE SO I SHELVED IT AND I MADE THIS OTHER MOVIE ABOUT A BIG SHIP THAT SIX
JamesCameron_2010-0043766-0044544.wav HEN YOU KNOW I WENT IN PINCHED IT TO THE STUDIO AS ROMEO AND JULIET ON A SHIP THAT'S GOING TO BE THIS EPIC ROMANCE PASSIONATE
JamesCameron_2010-0044544-0045285.wav THE FILM SECRETLY WHAT I WANTED TO DO WAS I WANTED TO DIVE TO THE REAL WRECK OF TITANIC AND THAT'S WHY I MADE THE MOVE
JamesCameron_2010-0045701-0047036.wav AND THAT'S THE TRUTH NOW STUDIO DIDN'T KNOW THAT BUT I CONVINCED THEM I SAID I SAID WE'RE GOING TO DIVE TO THE RECORD AND A FILLMENT FOR REEL WILL BE USING IT IN THE OPENING OF THE FILM AND BE REALLY IMPORTANT TO BE A GREAT MARKETING HOOK AND I TALKED THEM INTO FUNDING AND EXPEDITION
JamesCameron_2010-0047209-0048197.wav SOUNDS CRAZY BUT THIS GOES BACK TO THAT THEME ABOUT YOU KNOW YOUR IMAGINATION CREATING A REALITY WHOSE ACTION CREATED A REALITY WERE IT SIX MONTHS LATER I FIND MYSELF IN A RUSSIAN SUBMERSIBLE
JamesCameron_2010-0048197-0048951.wav TWO AND A HALF MILES DOWN IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC LOOKING AT THE REAL TITANIC THROUGH THROUGH A VIEWPORT NOT A MOVIE NOT H D FOR REAL
JamesCameron_2010-0049251-0050136.wav NOW THAT THAT BLEW MY MIND AND YOU KNOW IT TOOK A LOT OF PREPARATION WE HAD TO BUILD CAMERAS AND LIGHTS AND ALL KINDS OF THINGS BUT IT STRUCK ME HOW MUCH THIS
JamesCameron_2010-0050136-0051700.wav DIVE THESE DEEP DIVES WAS LIKE A LIKE A SPACE MISSION YOU KNOW WHERE IT WAS IT WAS HIGHLY TECHNICAL AND A REQUIRED ENORMOUS PLANNING AND YOU GET IN THIS CAPS TILL YOU GO DOWN TO THIS DARK HOSTILE A ENVIRONMENT WHERE THERE'S NO HOPE OF RESCUE IF YOU CAN'T GET BACK BY YOURSELF
JamesCameron_2010-0051700-0052297.wav AND YOU KNOW I'VE THOUGHT NOW I'M I'M LIKE LIVING IN A SCIENCE FICTION MOVIE THIS IS REALLY COOL
JamesCameron_2010-0052297-0053526.wav AND SO I REALLY GOT BITTEN BY THE BUG OF DEEP OCEAN EXPLORATION OF COURSE THE CURIOSITY THE SCIENCE COMPONENT OF IT IT WAS EVERYTHING IT WAS ADVENTURE IT WAS CURIOSITY WAS IMAGINATION AND IT WAS IN EXPERIENCE
JamesCameron_2010-0053526-0054687.wav THAT HOLLYWOOD COULDN'T GIVE ME CAUSE YOU KNOW I CAN IMAGINE A CREATURE WHEN WE COULD CREATE A VISUAL EFFECT FOR IT BUT I COULDN'T IMAGINE WHAT I WAS SEEING OUT THAT WINDOW AS WE DID SOME OF OUR SUBSEQUENT EXPEDITIONS
JamesCameron_2010-0054687-0056291.wav I WAS SEEING CREATURES AT HYDROTHERMAL VANSON AND SOMETIMES THINGS THAT I HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE SOMETIMES THINGS THAT NO ONE HAD SEEN BEFORE THAT ACTUALLY WERE NOT DESCRIBED BY SCIENCE AT THE TIME THAT WE SAW THEM AND IMAGED THEM SO I WAS COMPLETELY SMITTEN BY THIS
JamesCameron_2010-0056291-0057780.wav AND HAD TO DO MORE AND SO I ASHLEY MADE A CONIC CURIOUS DECISION AFTER THE SUCCESS OF TITANIC I SETTLE CAN YOU NOMEN A PARK MY DAY JOB AS A HOLLYWOOD MOVIE MAKER AND I WANT TO GO BE A FULL TIME EXPLORER FOR A WHILE
JamesCameron_2010-0057780-0059409.wav AND SO IN WE STARTED PLANNING THESE THESE EXPEDITIONS AND WE WENT UP GOING TO THE BIZMARRE AND AND EXPLORING IT WITH THE WITH THE ROMANTIC VEHICLES WE WENT BACK THE TITANIC WRECK WE TOOK LITTLE POTS THAT WE HAD CREATED THAT SPOOLED A FIRE OPTIC
JamesCameron_2010-0059409-0060516.wav AND THAT THE IDEA WAS TO GO IN INTO AN INTERIOR SURVEY OF THAT SHIP AH WHICH HAD NEVER BEEN DONE NOBODY EVER LOOKED INSIDE DIRECTED AND HAVE THE MEANS TO DO IT SO WE CREATED TECHNOLOGY TO DO IT
JamesCameron_2010-0060516-0061650.wav TO YOU KNOW HERE I AM NOW ON THE DECK OF TITANIC SITTING IN A SUBMERSIBLE AND LOOKING OUT AT PLANKS THAT LOOKED MUCH LIKE THIS WHERE I KNEW THAT THE BAND HAD PLAYED
JamesCameron_2010-0061650-0062708.wav THEN I'M FLYING A LITTLE ROMANTIC VEHICLE THROUGH THE CORRIDOR OF THE SHIP IN A WHAT I SAY OF ION I'M I'M OPERATING IT BUT MY MIND IS IN THE VEHICLE
JamesCameron_2010-0062708-0063644.wav I FELT LIKE I WAS PHYSICALLY PRESENT INSIDE THE SHIPWRECK OF TITANIC AND IT WAS THE MOST SERENE CANADAJAVO EXPERIENCE I I EVER HAD BECAUSE
JamesCameron_2010-0063644-0064675.wav I WOULD KNOW BEFORE I TURNED A CORNER WHAT WAS GOING TO BE THERE BEFORE THE LIGHTS OF THE VEHICLE ACTUALLY REVEALED IT BECAUSE I HAD WALKED THE SET FOR MONTHS WHEN WE WERE MAKING THE MOVIE
JamesCameron_2010-0064675-0065602.wav AND THE SET WAS BASED AS AN EXACT REPLICA ON THE BLUE PRINTS OF THE SHIP SO THERE WAS THIS ABSOLUTE REMARKABLE EXPERIENCE IN IT REALLY
JamesCameron_2010-0065602-0066346.wav MADE ME REALIZE THAT YOU'LL TELL A PRESENT EXPERIENCE THAT YOU ACTUALLY CAN HAVE THESE ROMANTIC AVATARS THEN YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS
JamesCameron_2010-0066346-0067623.wav AS IT IS AN INJECTED INTO THE INTO THE VEHICLE INTO THIS THIS OTHER FORM OF EXISTENCE IT WAS REALLY REALLY QUITE PROFOUND AND IT MAY BE A LITTLE BIT OF A GLIMPSE TO TO WHAT MIGHT BE HAPPENING ME OF SOME DECADES OUT AS A
JamesCameron_2010-0067623-0069120.wav AS WE START TO HAVE A SIDEBOARD BODY IS FOR EXPLORATION OR FOR OTHER MEANS AND IN MANY SORT OF AH POST HUMAN FUTURES THAT I CAN IMAGINE AS A SCIENCE FIXING HIM SO HAVING DONE THESE THESE ZEB
JamesCameron_2010-0069120-0070141.wav AH EXPEDITIONS AH AND AND IN A REALLY BEGINNING TO APPRECIATE WHAT WAS DOWN THERE SUCH AS AT THE AT THE DEEP OCEAN VENTS WHERE WE HAD THESE
JamesCameron_2010-0070141-0070987.wav AMAZING AMAZING ANIMALS THEIR BASE BASICAL ALIENS RIGHT HERE ON EARTH THEY LIVE IN A AN ENVIRONMENT OF CAMEO SYNTHESIS THEY DON'T SURVIVE
JamesCameron_2010-0070987-0072201.wav ON SUNLIGHT BASED SYSTEM AWAY WE DO AND SO YOUR SEEING ANIMALS THAT ARE LIVING NEXT TO A FIVE HUNDRED DEGREE CENTIGRADE WATER PLUMES THAT DO YOU THINK THEY CAN'T POSSIBLY EXIST AT THE SAME TIME
JamesCameron_2010-0072254-0072878.wav I WAS GETTING VERY INTERESTED IN SPACE SCIENCE AS WELL AGAIN NOW IT'S THE SCIENCE FICTION INFLUENCE AS A KID
JamesCameron_2010-0072878-0074496.wav AND I WOUND UP GETTING INVOLVED WITH A THE SPACE COMMUNITY REALLY INVOLVED WITH THAT WITH NASSA SITTING ON THE NASS ADVISERY BOARD PLANNING A ACTUAL SPACE MISSIONS GOING TO RUSSIA GOING THROUGH THE PRE COSMO NOT BY A MEDICAL PROTOCOLS AND ALL THESE SORTS OF THINGS
JamesCameron_2010-0074496-0075594.wav ACTUALLY GO AND FLY TO THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION WITH OUR THREE DI CAMERA SYSTEMS AND THIS WAS FASCINATING BUT WHAT WHAT I WANT OF DOING WAS BRINGING SPACE SCIENTIST WITH US INTO THE DEEP
JamesCameron_2010-0075594-0076495.wav AND TAKING THEM DOWN SO THAT THEY HAD ACCESS MASTER BIOLOGISTS PLANETARY SCIENCES PEOPLE WHO WERE INTERESTED IN THESE EXTREME OF FINE ENVIRONMENTS
JamesCameron_2010-0076495-0077585.wav TAKING THEM DOWN TO THE EVENTS AND LETTING THEM SEE AND TAKE SAMPLES AND TEST INSTRUMENTS AND SONG SO HERE WE WERE MAKING DOCUMENTARY FILMS BUT ACTUALLY DOING SCIENCE AND ACTUALLY DOING SPACE SCIENCE
JamesCameron_2010-0077585-0078414.wav I COMPLETELY CLOSED THE LOOP BETWEEN BEING THE SCIENCE FICTION FAN YOU KNOW AS A KID AND DOING THIS STUFF FOR REAL
JamesCameron_2010-0078414-0079453.wav AND IN A ALONG THE WAY THAT IN THIS JOURNEY OF DISCOVERY I LEARNED A LOT I LEARNED A LOT ABOUT SCIENCE BUT I ALSO LEARNED A LOT ABOUT
JamesCameron_2010-0079453-0080336.wav LEADERSHIP AND YOU THINK DIRECTORS GOT TO BE A LEADER LEADER OF NEON CAPTAIN THE SHIP ALL ITS EARTHING I NEVER REALLY LEARN ABOUT LEADERSHIP UNTIL
JamesCameron_2010-0080400-0081340.wav I DID THESE EXPEDITIONS BECAUSE I HAD TO AT A CERTAIN POINT SAY WHAT AM I DOING OUT HERE WHY AM I DOING THIS WHAT DO I GET OUT OF HIM
JamesCameron_2010-0081340-0082831.wav WE DON'T MAKE MONEY AT THESE DAM SHOWS AND ALL WE BARELY BREAK EVEN THERE'S NO FAME IN IT PEOPLE SURE TO THINK I WENT AWAY BETWEEN TITANIC AND AVATERN WAS BUFFING MY NAILS SOME PLACED IN A SITTING AT THE BEACH MADE ALL THESE FILMS MADE ALL THESE DOCUMENTARY FILMS THAT YOU KNOW FOUR VERY
JamesCameron_2010-0082831-0083636.wav LIMITED AUDIENCE IN NO FAME NO GLORY NO MONEY WHAT ARE YOU DOING YOU'RE DOING IT FOR THE TASK ITSELF FOR THE CHALLENGE
JamesCameron_2010-0083636-0084543.wav AND THE OCEAN IS THE MOST CHANGING ENVIRONMENT THERE IS FOR THE THRILL OF DISCOVERY AND FOR THAT STRANGE BOND THAT HAPPENS
JamesCameron_2010-0084543-0085373.wav WHEN A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE FORMED A TIGHTLY NINETEEN AS WE WOULD DO THESE THINGS WITH TEN TWELVE PEOPLE WORKING FOR YEARS AT A TIME
JamesCameron_2010-0085373-0086199.wav SOMETIMES AT SEA FOR FOR FOR TWO THREE MONTHS AT A TIME AND IN THAT BOND YOU REALIZE THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
JamesCameron_2010-0086199-0086699.wav IS THE RESPECT THAT YOU HAVE FOR THEM THAT THEY HAVE FOR YOU THAT YOU HAVE DONE A TASK
JamesCameron_2010-0086699-0088026.wav THAT YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN TO SOME ONE ELSE WHEN YOU COME BACK TO THAT SHORE AND YOU SAY WE KNOW WE HAD TO DO THIS AND THE FIBRE OPTIC AND THE ATTENUATION AND THAT THIS AND THAT ALL THE TECHNOLOGY OF IT AND THE DIFFICULTY THE HUMAN PERFORMANCE ASPECTS OF WORKING AT SEA
JamesCameron_2010-0088026-0089464.wav YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN IT TO PEOPLE IT'S THAT THING THAT MAYBE COPS HAVE OR PEOPLE IN IN COMBAT THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH SOMETHING TOGETHER AND THEY KNOW THEY CAN NEVER EXPLAIN IT CREATES A BOND CRETES A BOND OF RESPECT SO WHEN I CAME BACK TO MAKE MY NEXT MOVIE WHICH WAS AVATAR
JamesCameron_2010-0089464-0090687.wav I TRIED TO APPLY THAT SAME PRINCIPLE OF LEADERSHIP WHICH IS THAT YOU RESPECT YOUR TEAM AND YOU ARE IN THEIR RESPECT IN RETURN AND IT REALLY CHANGED THE DYNAMIC SO HERE I WAS AGAIN WITH A SMALL TEAM
JamesCameron_2010-0090687-0091838.wav AND YOU KNOW AN UNCHARTED TERRITORY DOING ABITER COMING UP WITH NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT DIDN'T EXIST BEFORE TREMENDOUSLY EXCITING AH TREMENDOUSLY CHALLENGING AND WE BECAME A FAMILY
JamesCameron_2010-0091838-0093533.wav OVER A FOUR AND A HALF YEAR PERIOD A COMPLETELY CHANGED HOW I DO MOVIE SO PEOPLE OF COMMENT ON HOW YOU IN OA YOU BROUGHT BACK THE OCEAN A ORGANISMS AND PUT THEM ON THE PLANET OF PANDORA TO ME IT WAS MORE BE FUNDAMENTAL WAY OF DOING BUSINESS THE PROCESS ITSELF THAT CHANGED AS A RESULT OF THAT
JamesCameron_2010-0093533-0094908.wav SO WHAT CAN WE SYMPATHIZE OUT OF ALL THIS YOU KNOW WHAT'S THAT ONE OF THE LESSONS LEARN WELL I THINK NUMBER ONE IS CURIOSITY IT'S THE MOST POWERFUL THING YOU OWN IMAGINATION
JamesCameron_2010-0094908-0096211.wav IS A FORCE THAT CAN ACTUALLY MANIFEST A REALITY AND THE RESPECT OF YOUR TEAM IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ALL THE LAURELS IN THE WORLD
JamesCameron_2010-0096287-0096507.wav I HAVE YOUNG FILL MAKERS
JamesCameron_2010-0096507-0096894.wav COME UP TO ME AND SAY AND I'LL GIVE ME SOME ADVICE FOR DOING THIS
JamesCameron_2010-0096894-0097074.wav AND I SAVED
JamesCameron_2010-0097074-0098428.wav DON'T PUT LIMITATIONS ON YOURSELF OTHER PEOPLE WILL DO THAT FOR YOU DON'T DO IT TO YOURSELF DON'T BET AGAINST YOURSELF AND AND TAKE RISKS AH AN ASSA HAS THIS HAS THIS SOFT PHRASE THAT THEY LIKE FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION
JamesCameron_2010-0098428-0099454.wav BUT FAILURE HAS TO BE AN OPTION IN ART AND AN EXPLORATION BECAUSE ITS A LEAP OF FAITH AND NO IMPORTANT ENDEAVOUR THAT REQUIRED INNOVATION
JamesCameron_2010-0099454-0100510.wav WAS DONE WITHOUT RISK YOU HAVE TO BE WILLING TO TAKE THOSE RISKS SO THAT'S THE THOUGHT I WOULD LEAVE YOU WITH IS IT IN WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING FAILURE
JamesCameron_2010-0100510-0101065.wav IS AN OPTION BUT FEAR IS NOT THANK YOU
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0001547-0003185.wav I WONDER I'M GAME DESIGNER I'VE BEEN MAKING GAMES ON LINE NOW FOR TEN YEARS AND MY GOAL FOR THE NEXT DECADE IS TO TRY TO MAKE IT AS EASY TO SAVE THE WORLD IN REAL LIFE AS IT IS TO SAVE THE WORLD IN ALL MINE GAMES
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0003185-0003953.wav NOW I HAVE A PLAN FOR THIS AND IT ENTAILS CONVINCING MORE PEOPLE INCLUDING ALL OF YOU TO SPEND MORE TIME
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0003953-0004822.wav PLAYING BIGGER AND BETTER GAMES RIGHT NOW WE SPEND THREE BILLION HOURS A WEEK PLAYING ON LINE GAMES SOME OF YOU MIGHT BE THINKING
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0004822-0006200.wav THAT'S A LOT OF TIME TO SPEND PLAYING GAMES MAY BE TOO MUCH TIME CONSIDERING HOW MANY URGENT PROBLEMS WE HAVE TO SOLVE IN THE REAL WORLD AND BUT ACTUALLY ACCORDING TO MY RESEARCH AT THE INSTITUTE FOR THE FUTURE AH IT'S ACTUALLY THE OPPOSITE IT'S TRUE
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0006200-0006901.wav THREE BILLION HOURS A WEEK IS NOT NEARLY ENOUGH GAME PLAY TO SOLVE THE WORLD'S MOST URGENT PROBLEMS ON IN FACT
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0006901-0008015.wav I BELIEVE THAT IF WE WANT TO SURVIVE THE NEXT CENTURY ON THIS PLANET WE NEED TO INCREASE THAT TOTAL DRAMATICALLY I'VE CALCULATED THE TOTAL WE NEED AT TWENTY ONE BILLION HOURS OF GAME PLAY EVERY WEEK
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0008015-0009135.wav SO THAT'S A PROBABLY A BIT OF A COUNTER INTOIT OF IDEA SO I'LL JUST ELL SAY IT AGAIN LET IT SINK IN IF WE WANT TO SAW PROBLEMS LIKE HUNGER POVERTY CLIMATE CHANGE GLOBEAL CONFLICT OBESITY
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0009135-0009939.wav I BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO ASPIRE TO PLAY GAMES ALL MINE FOR AT LEAST TWENTY ONE MILLION HOURS A WEEK BY THE END OF THE NEXT DECADE
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0009939-0010122.wav NO I'M SERIOUS
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0010122-0011067.wav I AM HERE IS WHY THIS PICTURE PRETTY MUCH SUMS UP WHY I THINK GAMES ARE SO ESSENTIAL TO THE FUTURE SURVIVAL OF THE HUMAN SPECIES TRULY
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0011067-0012090.wav THIS IS A PORTRAIT BY A PHOTOGRAPHERNING PHIL TOLDONO HE WANTED TO CAPTURE THE EMOTION OF GAMING SO HE SAID OF A CAMERA IN FRONT OF GAMERS WHILE THEY WERE PLAYING AND THIS IS A CLASSIC
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0012090-0012997.wav GAMING EMOTION NOW AH IF YOU'RE NOT A GAME OR YOU MIGHT MISS SOME OF THE NEW AUNTS IN THIS PHOTO YOU PROBABLY SEE THE SENSE OF URGENCY A LITTLE BIT OF
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0012997-0015153.wav FEAR BUT INTENSE CONCENTRATION DEEP DEEP FOCUS ON TACKLING A REALLY DIFFICULT PROBLEM AH IF YOU ARE A GAME OR YOU WILL NOTICE A FEW NEW AUNTS IS HERE THE CRINKLE OF THE EYES UP AND AROUND THE MOUTH IS A SIGN OF OPTIMISM AND THE EYEBROWS UP IS SURPRISED THIS IS A GAMEER WHO'S ON THE VERGE OF SOMETHING CALLED AN EPOCH WIND NOW IT
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0015267-0016700.wav OH YOU HEARD OF THAT O K GOOD SO WE HAVE SOME NEIGHBORS AMONG US SO AN EPICQUIN IS AN OUTCOME THAT IS SO EXTRAORDINARILY POSITIVE YOU HAD NO IDEA IT WAS EVEN POSSIBLE UNTIL YOU ACHIEVED IT AH IT WAS ALMOST BEYOND THE THRESHOLD OF IMAGINATION
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0016700-0017159.wav AND WHEN YOU GET THERE YOU ARE SHOCKED TO DISCOVER WHAT YOU'RE TRULY CAPABLE OF THAT'S AN EPIC WENT
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0017159-0018374.wav THIS IS A GAMEER ON THE VERGE OF AN EPIC WIND AND THIS IS THE FACE THAT WE NEED TO SEE ON MILLIONS OF PROBLEM SALVERS ALL OVER THE WORLD AS WE TRY TO TACKLE THE OBSTACLES OF THE NEXT CENTURY THE FACE OF SOME ONE
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0018374-0019692.wav WHO AGAINST ALL ODDS IS ON THE VERGE OF AN EPIC WIND NOW UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS MORE OF THE FACE THAT WE SEE IN EVERY DAY LIFE NOW AS WE TRY TO TACKLE URGENT PROBLEMS THIS IS WHAT I CALL THE I'M NOT GOOD AT LIFE FACE AND IS ACTUALLY ME

JaneMcGonigal_2010-0022947-0024137.wav I BELIEVE THAT MANY OF US BECOME THE BEST VERSION OF OURSELVES THE MOST LIKELY TO HELP AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE THE MOST LIKELY TO STICK WITH A PROBLEM AS LONG AS IT TAKES TO GET UP AFTER FAILURE AND TRY AGAIN AM AND IN REAL LIFE
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0024137-0025275.wav WHEN WE'RE SWIM WE FACE FAILURE WHEN WE CONFRONT OBSTACLES WE OFTEN DON'T FEEL THAT WAY WE FEEL OVERCOME WE FEEL OVERWHELMED WE FEEL ANXIOUS MAY BE DEPRESSED FRUSTRATED OR CYNICAL
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0025275-0026562.wav WE NEVER HAVE THOSE FEELINGS ON OUR PLAYING GAMES THEY JUST DON'T EXIST IN GAMES SO THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO STUDY WHEN I WAS A GRADUATE STUDENT WHAT ABOUT GAMES MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO FEEL THAT WE CAN'T ACHIEVE EVERYTHING HOW CAN WE
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0026562-0027737.wav TAKE THOSE FEELINGS FROM GAMES AND APPLY THEM TO REAL WORLD WORK SO LOOKED AT GAMES LIKE WORLD OF WARCRAFT WHICH IS REALLY THE IDEAL COLLABATIVE PROBLEM SOVING ENVIRONMENT AND I STARTED TO NOTICE A FEW THINGS THAT MAKE
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0027737-0029044.wav EPIC WINDS SO POSSIBLE IN ALL MIND WORLDS SO THE FIRST THING IS WHENEVER YOU SHOW UP IN ONE OF THESE ALL MIND GAMES ESPECIALLY IN WORLD OF FORECRAFT THERE ARE LOTS AND LOTS OF DIFFERENT CHARACTERS WHO ARE WILLING TO TRUST YOU WITH A WORLD SAVING MISCHIEF

JaneMcGonigal_2010-0030073-0030993.wav BUT IT IS ON THE THE VERGE OF WHAT YOU'RE CAPABLE OF SO YOU HAVE TO TRY HARD BUT THERE'S NO UNEMPLOYMENT IN WORLD OF WAR CRAFT THERE'S NO SITTING AROUND WRINGING YOUR HANDS IS ALWAYS SOMETHING SPECIFIC
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0030993-0031600.wav AND IMPORTANT TO BE DONE AND THERE ARE ALSO TONS OF CLABERATORS EVERYWHERE YOU GO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0031600-0032864.wav READY TO WORK WITH YOU TO ACHIEVE YOUR EPIC MISSION AS NOT SOMETHING WE HAVE IN A REAL LIFE THAT EASILY THE SUNSET AT OUR FINGER TIPS OUR TONS OF COLLABRIATORS AND ALSO THERE IS EPIC STORY THIS INSPIRING STORY IF I WERE THERE

JaneMcGonigal_2010-0035286-0037175.wav IS THAT IT'S SO SATISFYING TO BE ON THE VERGE OF AN EPIGUIN ALL THE TIME THAT WE DECIDE TO SPEND ALL OUR TIME IN THESE GAME WORLDS IS JUST BETTER THAN REALITY SO SO FAR ON COLLECTIVELY ALL THE WORLD OF WORKRAFT GAMERS HAVE SPENT FIVE POINT NINE THREE MILLION YEARS SOLVING THE VIRTUAL PROBLEMS OF AZARATH NOW
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0037175-0037995.wav THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY A BAD THING IT MIGHT SOUND LIKE AS A BAD THING BUT TO PUT THAT IN CONTEXT FIVE POINT NINE THREE MILLION YEARS AGO WAS WHEN
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0037995-0039167.wav OUR EARLIEST PRIMATE HUMAN ANCESTORS STOOD UP THAT WAS THE FIRST UPRIGHT PRIMATE O K SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HOW MUCH TIME WERE CURLY INVESTING AND PLAYING GAMES
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0039167-0040609.wav THE ONLY WAY IT MAKES SENSE TO EVEN THINK ABOUT IT IS TO TALK ABOUT TIME AT THE MAGNITUDE OF HUMAN EVOLUTION AH WHICH IS AN EXTRAORDINARY THING BUT IT'S ALSO APT BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THAT BY SPENDING ALL THE TIME PLAYING GAMES WERE ACTUALLY CHANGING
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0040609-0041625.wav WHAT WE ARE CAPABLE OF AS HUMAN BEINGS WE ARE EVOLVING TO BE A MORE COLLABORATIVE AND HEARTY SPECIES THIS IS TRUE I BELIEVE US SO CONSIDER THIS REALLY INTERESTING STATISTIC
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0041625-0042427.wav IT WAS RECENTLY PUBLISHED BY RESEARCHRIC CARNEGIE MALLIN UNIVERSITY THE AVERAGE YOUNG PERSON TO DAY IN A COUNTRY WITH A STRONG GAMER CULTURE
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0042427-0043461.wav WILL HAVE SPENT TEN THOUSAND HOURS PLAYING ON MY GAMES BY THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE NOW TEN THOUSAND HOURS IS A REALLY INTERESTING NUMBER FOR TWO REASONS FIRST OF ALL
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0043461-0044623.wav FOR CHILDREN IN THE UNITED STATES TEN THOUSAND AND EIGHTY HOURS IS THE EXACT AMOUNT OF TIME YOU WILL SPEND IN SCHOOL FROM FIFTH GRADE TO HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION IF YOU HAVE PERFECT ATTENDANCE
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0044623-0045642.wav SO WE HAVE AN ENTIRE PARALLEL TRACK OF EDUCATION GOING ON WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE LEARNING AS MUCH ABOUT WHAT IT TAKES TO BE A GOOD GAMEER AS THEY ARE LEARNING ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE IN SCHOOL
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0045642-0046931.wav SOME OF YOU HAD PROBABLY READ MALCOLM GLADWELL'S NEW BOOK OUTLIERS SO YOU WOULD HAVE HEARD OF HIS THEORY OF SUCCESS THE TEN THOUSAND HOURS THEORY OF SUCCESS ITS BASE ON THIS GREAT PAGAN OF SCIENCE RESEARCH THAT IF WE CAN MASTER
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0046931-0048034.wav TEN THOUSAND HOURS OF EFFORTFUL STUDY AT ANYTHING BY THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE WE WILL BE VIRTUOSO'S AT IT WILL BE AS GOOD AT WHATEVER WE DO AS THE GREATEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD AM AND SO
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0048034-0048891.wav NOW WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS AN ENTIRE GENERATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE VIRTUOSO GAMERS SO THE BIG QUESTION IS
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0048891-0049885.wav WHAT EXACTLY OUR GAMEERS GETTING SO GOOD AT BECAUSE IF WE COULD FIGURE THAT OUT WE WOULD HAVE A VIRTUALLY UNPRECEDENTED HUMAN RESOURCE ON OUR HANDS
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0049885-0051044.wav THIS IS HOW MANY PEOPLE WE HAD OUT HAVE IN THE WORLD WHO SPEND AT LEAST AN HOUR DAY PLAYING ON MY GAMES THESE ARE OUR VIRTUOSO GAMERS FIVE UNDER MILLION PEOPLE WHO ARE EXTRAORDINARILY GOOD AT SOMETHING
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0051044-0051590.wav AND IN THE NEXT DECADE WE CAN HAVE ANOTHER BILLION GAMERS WHO ARE EXTERNALLY GOOD
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0051590-0052984.wav AT WHATEVER THAT IS IF YOU DON'T KNOW IT ALREADY THIS IS COMING THE GAME INDUSTRY IS DEVELOPING CONSULS THAT ARE LOW ENERGY AND THAT WORK WITH THE WIRELESS PHONE NET WORKS INSTEAD OF A BRABIAN INNER NET SO THAT GAMERS ALL OVER THE WORLD PARTICULARLY IN INDIA
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0052984-0053672.wav CHINA BRAZIL CAN GET ON LINE THEY EXPECT ONE BILLION MORE GAMERS AND NEXT DECADE SO BRING BACK TO ONE POINT THY BILLION GAMERS
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0053672-0054261.wav SO I STARTED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THESE GAMES ARE MAKING US VIRTUOSES AT HERE THE FOUR THINGS I CAME UP WITH
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0054261-0055664.wav THE FIRST IS URGENT OPTIMISM KAY THINK OF THIS IS EXTREME SELF MOTIVATION URGENT OPTIMISM IS THE DESIRE TO ACT IMMEDIATELY TO TACKLE AN OBSTACLE COMBINED WITH THE BELIEF THAT WE HAVE A REASONABLE HOPE OF SUCCESS
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0055664-0056373.wav GAMER IS ALWAYS BELIEVE THAT AN EPIQUENT IS POSSIBLE AND THAT IS ALWAYS WORTH TRYING AND TRYING NOW GAMERS NOT SET AROUND
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0056373-0057463.wav KATE GAMEERS OUR VIRTUOSO'S AT WEAVING A TIGHT SOCIAL FABRIC FOR THE LOT OF INTERESTING RESEARCH THAT SHOWS THAT WE LIKE PEOPLE BETTER AFTER WE PLAY A GAME WITH THEM EVEN IF THEY BEATEN US BADLY
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0057463-0059425.wav THE REASON IS IT TAKES A LOT OF TRUST TO PLAY GAME WITH SOMEONE WE TRUST THAT THEY WILL SPEND THEIR TIME WITH US THAT THEY WILL PLAY BY THE SAME RULES VALUE THE SAME GOAL THEY'LL STAY WITH THE GAME UNTIL IT'S OVER AND SO PLAYING A GAME TOGETHER ACTUALLY BUILDS UP BONDS AND TRUSTS AND CO OPERATION ON AND THEN WE ACTUALLY BUILD STRONGER SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS AS A RESULT
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0059425-0060796.wav BLISSFUL PRODUCTIVITY I LOVE IT IT IS A REASON WHY THE AVERAGE WORLD OF WORKRAFT GAMER PLAYS FOR TWENTY TWO HOURS A WEEK COME THE HALF TIME JOB IT'S BECAUSE WE KNOW WHEN WE'RE PLAYING A GAME THEY WERE ACTUALLY HAPPIER WORKING HARD THAN WE ARE
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0060796-0062073.wav RELAXING OR HANGING OUT WE KNOW THAT WE ARE OPTOMIZED AS HUMAN BEINGS TO DO HARD A MEANINGFUL WORK AND GAMEERS ARE WILLING TO WORK HARD ALL THE TIME IF FORGIVEN THE RIGHT WORK FINALLY EPIC MEANING
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0062073-0063491.wav GAMER'S LOVE TO BE ATTACHED TO AWE INSPIRING MISSIONS TO HUMAN PLANETARY SCALE STORIES SO JUST ONE BIT OF TRIVIA THAT HELPS PUT THAT INTO PERSPECTIVE AH SO YOU ALL KNOW WICKIE PEDIA
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0063491-0064212.wav BIGGEST WICKEY IN THE WORLD SECOND BIGGEST WICKED IN THE WORLD WITH NEARLY EIGHTY THOUSAND ARTICLES IS THE WORLD OF WORKRAFT WICKEY

JaneMcGonigal_2010-0065979-0066602.wav TO ONE THING GAMEERS ARE SUPERIMPOWERED HOPEFUL INDIVIDUALS
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0066602-0067935.wav THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE INDIVIDUALLY CAPABLE OF CHANGING THE WORLD AND THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE CAPABLE OF CHANGING VIRTUAL WORLDS AND NOT THE REAL WORLD THAT'S PROBLEM THAT I'M TRYING TO SOLVE
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0067935-0068838.wav AH THERE'S A KINDNESS NAME EVER CASTRONOVA WHOSE WORK IS BRILLIANT HE LOOKS AT WHY PEOPLE ARE INVESTING SO MUCH TIME AN ENERGY AND MONEY IN ON LINE WORLDS

JaneMcGonigal_2010-0070540-0071959.wav THAT THIS MAKES PERFECT SENSE BECAUSE GAMERERS CAN ACHIEVE MORE IN ALL MY WORLDS AND THEY CAN IN REAL LIFE THEY CAN HAVE STRONGER SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS AND GAMES AND THEY CAN HAVE IN REAL LIFE THEY GET BETTER FEET BACK AND FEEL MORE REWARDED IN GAMES THAN THEY DO IN REAL LIFE SO HE SAYS
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0071959-0072539.wav FOR NOW IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE FOR GAMERS HAS BEEN MORE TIME IN VIRTUAL WORLDS THAN THE REAL WORLD NOW
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0072539-0073742.wav I ALSO AGREE THAT THAT IS RATIONAL FOR NOW BUT IT IS NOT BY ANY MEANS AN OPTIMAL SITUATION WE HAVE TO START MAKING THE REAL WORLD WALK MORE LIKE A GAME SO I TAKE MY INSPIRATION FROM SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED

RobertGupta_2010U-0017463-0018319.wav AND THAT I WOULD RUIN HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE VIOLIN IF I STARTED TALKING ABOUT SCALES AND ARPEGGIOS AND OTHER EXCITING FORMS OF DIDACTIC VILE IN PENAGOGY
RobertGupta_2010U-0018419-0018704.wav SO I JUST STARTED PLAYING
RobertGupta_2010U-0018704-0019867.wav AND I PLAYED THE FIRST MOVEMENT OF THE BAIT OF A VIOLENT CONCERTO AND AS I PLAYED I UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE WAS A PROFOUND CHANGE OCCURRING IN NATHANIEL'S EYES
RobertGupta_2010U-0019867-0020541.wav IT WAS AS IF HE WAS IN THE GRIP OF SOME INVISIBLE FARMER SUITICAL A CHEMICAL REACTION FOR WHICH MY PLAYING THE MUSIC
RobertGupta_2010U-0020541-0021229.wav WAS ITS CATTLEIST AND THE FANIELS MANIC RAGE
RobertGupta_2010U-0021229-0022001.wav WAS TRANSFORMED INTO UNDERSTANDING A QUIET CURIOSITY AND GRACE
RobertGupta_2010U-0022001-0023301.wav AND IN A MIRACLE HE LIFTED HIS OWN VIOLIN AND HE STARTED PLAYING BY EAR CERTAIN SNIPPETS OF VIOLENT CONCERTOS WHICH HE THEN ASKED ME TO COMPLETE MENDELSSON TSCHAIKOVSKY SABELLIUS

RobertGupta_2010U-0027836-0029180.wav MUSIC CHANGES US AND FOR NATHANIEL MUSIC IS SANITY BECAUSE MUSIC ALLOWS HIM TO TAKE HIS THOUGHTS AND DELUSIONS AND SHAPE THEM THROUGH HIS IMAGINATION AND HIS CRETIVITY INTO REALITY
RobertGupta_2010U-0029180-0029611.wav AND THAT IS IN ESCAPE FROM HIS TORMENTED STATE
RobertGupta_2010U-0029611-0030712.wav AND I UNDERSTOOD THAT THIS WAS THE VERY ESSENCE OF ART THIS WAS THE VERY REASON WHY WE MADE MUSIC THAT WE TAKE SOMETHING THAT EXISTS WITHIN ALL OF US AT OUR VERY FUNDAMENTAL CORPS OUR EMOTIONS
RobertGupta_2010U-0030712-0031379.wav AND THROUGH OUR ARTISTIC LENS THROUGH OUR CRETIVITY WERE ABLE TO SHAPE THOSE EMOTIONS INTO REALITY
RobertGupta_2010U-0031379-0032294.wav AND THE REALITY OF THAT EXPRESSION REACHES ALL OF US AND MOVES US INSPIRES AND UNITES US
RobertGupta_2010U-0032294-0032808.wav AND FOR NATHANIEL MUSIC BROUGHT HIM BACK INTO A FOLD OF FRIENDS
RobertGupta_2010U-0032808-0033863.wav THE REDEMPTIVE POWER OF MUSIC BROUGHT HIM BACK INTO A FAMILY OF MUSICIANS THAT UNDERSTOOD HIM THAT RECOGNIZED HIS TALENTS AND RESPECTED HIM
RobertGupta_2010U-0033863-0035117.wav AND I WILL ALWAYS MAKE MUSIC WITH NATHANIEL WHETHER WE ARE AT WHAT DOES HE CONCERT HALL OR ON SKID ROW BECAUSE HE REMINDS ME WHY I BECAME A MUSICIAN THANK YOU
RobertGupta_2010U-0035819-0036045.wav FAZIER FAST
RobertGupta_2010U-0036123-0036220.wav NEVER GETS UP
RobertGupta_2010U-0038266-0038703.wav AND IN A PLACE SOMETHING THAT I SHAMELESSLY STOLE FROM CELLISTS SO PLEASED FORGIVE YOU
TomWujec_2010U-0001626-0004156.wav THREE YEARS AGO HERE AT TED PETER SKILLMAN INTRODUCED A DESIGN CHALLENGE CALLED THE MARSHMALLOW CHALLENGE AND THE IDEA IS PRETTY SIMPLE TEAMS OF FOUR HAVE TO BUILD THE TALLEST FREE STANDING STRUCTURE OUT OF TWENTY STICKS ASPAGHETTY ONE YARD OF TAPE ONE YARD OF STRING AND A MARTIANALOW THE MARTIANAL HAS TO BE ON TOP AND THOUGH IT SEEMS REALLY SIMPLE IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY HARD BECAUSE IT FORCES PEOPLE TO COLLABORATE VERY QUICKLY
TomWujec_2010U-0004156-0004920.wav AND SO I THOUGHT THIS WAS AN INTERESTING IDEA AND I INCORPORATED INTO A DESIGN WORKSHOP AND IT WAS A HUGE SUCCESS AND SINCE THEN I'VE
TomWujec_2010U-0004920-0006666.wav CONDUCTED ABOUT SEVENTY DESIGN WORKSHOPS ACROSS THE WORLD WITH STUDENTS AND DESIGNER IS IN ARCHITECTS EVEN THE SCITIOS OF THE FORTUNE FIFTY AND THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THIS EXERCISE THAT REVEALS VERY DEEP LESSONS ABOUT THE NATURE OF COLLABORATION AND I LIKE TO SHARE SOME OF THEM WITH YOU SO
TomWujec_2010U-0006666-0008700.wav NORMALLY MOST PEOPLE BEGIN BY ORIENTING THEMSELVES TO THE TASK THEY TALK ABOUT IT THEY FIGURE AT WHAT IS GOING A LOOK LIKE THEY JOCKEY FOR POWER THEN THEY SPEND SOME TIME PLANNING ORGANIZING THEY SKETCH IN THEY LAY OUTS FORGETTY AH THEY'D SPEND THE MAJORITY OF THEIR TIME ASSEMBLING THE STICKS INTO EVER GROWING STRUCTURES AND THEN
TomWujec_2010U-0008700-0009587.wav FINALLY JUST AS THEY'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME SOME ONE TAKES OUT THE MARSHMELLOW AND THEN THEY GINGERLY PUT IT ON TOP AND THEY STAND BACK
TomWujec_2010U-0009587-0009748.wav AND TUDA
TomWujec_2010U-0009748-0010954.wav THEY ADMIRE THEIR WORK BUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENS MOST THE TIME IS THAT THE TODAD TURNS INTO AN OH CAUSE THE WEIGHT OF THE MARSHMALLOW CAUSES THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE TO BUCKLE AND TO COLLAPSE SO
TomWujec_2010U-0010954-0011682.wav THERE ARE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO'D HAVE A LOT MORE OH MOMENTS THAN OTHERS AND AMONG THE WORST ARE RECENT GRADUATES OF BUSINESS SCHOOL
TomWujec_2010U-0011938-0013152.wav THEY LIE THAT A SHEEP THEY ARE GET DISTRACTED THEY'VE DONE THEY PRODUCE REALLY LAMED STRUCTURES AND OF COURSE THERE'S THEMES THAT HAVE A LOT MORE TO DAY STRUCTURES AND AMONG THE BEST ARE RECENT GRADUATES OF KINDERGARTEN
TomWujec_2010U-0013299-0013334.wav
TomWujec_2010U-0013481-0014491.wav IT'S PRETTY MAZING AS PETER TELLS US OUGHT NOT ONLY TO DO THEY PRODUCE THE TALLEST STRUCTURES BUT THE MOST INTERESTING STRUCTURES OF THEM ALL SO THE QUESTION HE WHEN ASK IS HOW COME
TomWujec_2010U-0014491-0015269.wav WHY WHAT IS IT ABOUT THEM AND PETER LIKES TO SAY THAT NONE OF THE SKIN UNDER THE KIDS SPEND ANY TIME TRYING TO BE SEA EELS PICKETY INK
TomWujec_2010U-0015269-0016219.wav RIGHT THEY DON'T TIME SPEND TIME JOCKING FOR PART BUT THERE'S ANOTHER REASON IS WELL AND THE REASON IS THAT BUSINESS STUDENTS ARE TRAINED TO FIND THE SINGLE RIGHT PLAN
TomWujec_2010U-0016219-0016949.wav RIGHT AND THEN THEY EXECUTE ON IT AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS WHEN THEY PUT THE MARSH FELLOW ON TOP THEY RUN OUT OF TIME AND WHAT HAPPENS IT'S A CRISIS
TomWujec_2010U-0017131-0017995.wav SOUND FAMILIAR RIGHT O WHAT KINDER GARDENERS DO DIFFERENTLY IS THAT THEY START WITH THE MARSH MELLOW AND THEY BUILD PROTOTYPES SUCCESSIVE PROTOTYPES
TomWujec_2010U-0017995-0018863.wav ALWAYS KEEPING THE MARSHNALLOW IN TOPS OF THEY OF MULTIPLE TIMES ADD TO TO FIX IN A BUILT PROTOTYPES LONG THE WAY SO AS ANDREWS RECOGNIZED THIS TYPE OF COLLABORATION
TomWujec_2010U-0018863-0019612.wav AS THE ESSENCE OF THE ITERATIVE PROCESS AND WITH EACH VERSION KIDS GET INSTANT FEED BACK ABOUT WHAT WORKS AND WHAT DOESN'T WORK
TomWujec_2010U-0019612-0020200.wav SO THE CAPACITY TO PLAY AND PROTOTYPE IS IS REALLY ESSENTIAL BUT LET'S LOOK AT HOW DIFFERENT TEAMS PERFORM
TomWujec_2010U-0020200-0021385.wav SO THE AVERAGE FOR MOST PEOPLE IS AROUND TWENTY INCHES BUSINESS SCHOOLS DIDN'T MOUNT A HALF OF THAT LAWYERS LITTLE BETTER BUT NOT MUCH BETTER THAN THAT KINDERGARTENS BETTER THAN MOST ADULTS WHO DOES THE VERY BEST
TomWujec_2010U-0021385-0021767.wav ARCHITECTS AND ENGINEERS THANKFULLY AND
TomWujec_2010U-0022235-0023455.wav THIRTY NINE INCHES THE TALLEST STRUCTURE AH I'VE SEEN AND WHY IS IT BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND TRIANGLES AND SELF REINFORCING GEOMETRICAL PATTERNS OR THE KEY TO BUILDING SELF A REINFORCE AT THIS STABLE STRUCTURES
TomWujec_2010U-0023455-0024381.wav SO AS SEEOS LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN AVERAGE BUT HERE'S WHERE GETS INTERESTING IF YOU PUT IN EXECUTIVE ADMEN ON THE TEAM THEY GET SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER
TomWujec_2010U-0024554-0024688.wav YOU KNOW
TomWujec_2010U-0024688-0026094.wav LOOK AROUND TO GO OUT THAT TEAMSKINAWEN HE JUST TELL BEFOREHAND AND WHY'S THAT BECAUSE THEY HAVE SPECIAL SKILLS OF FACILITATION THEY MANAGE THE PROCESSLY UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS AND ANY TEAM WHO MANAGES AND PAYS A CLOSE ATTENTION TO TO WORK
TomWujec_2010U-0026094-0027044.wav AH IT WILL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE TEAMS PERFORMERS SPECIALIZED SKILLS AND FACILITATION SKILLS AT THE COMBINATION LEADS TO TO STRONG SUCCESS
TomWujec_2010U-0027044-0027776.wav IF YOU'RE TEN TEAM SAID TYPICALLY PERFORMED YOU'LL GET ME SIX OR SO THAT OF STANDING STRUCTURES IN I I TRIED SOMETHING INTERESTING I THOUGHT LET'S
TomWujec_2010U-0027776-0028693.wav UP THE ANTE ONCE SO I OFFERED A TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR PRIZE OF SOFT WORD TO THE WINNING TEAM SO WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED TO THESE DESIGNED STUDENTS WHAT WAS THE RESULT
TomWujec_2010U-0028693-0029055.wav HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED
TomWujec_2010U-0029055-0031142.wav NOT ONE TEAM HAD A STANDING STRUCTURE NOT ONE HAD A IF ANYONE HAD BUILT SAY A A ONE INSTRUCTOR LATER WOULD FORSAKEN HIM THAT THE PRIZE SO ISN'T IT INTERESTING THAT HIGH STAKES I HAVE A STRONG IMPET WE DID THE EXERCISE AGAIN WITH THE SAME STUDENTS WHAT YOU THINK HAPPENED THEN SO NOW THE UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF PROTOTYPING
TomWujec_2010U-0031142-0032519.wav SO THE SAME TEAM WENT FROM BEING THE VERY WORST TO BEING AMONG THE VERY BEST THEY PRODUCED THE TALLEST STRUCTURES IN THE LEAST AMOUNT OF TIME SO THERE'S A GREAT LESSONS FOR US ABOUT THE NATURE OF INCENTIVES AND SUCCESS
TomWujec_2010U-0032519-0033857.wav SO YOU MIGHT ASK WHY WOULD ANYONE ACTUALLY SPEND TIME RUNNING A MARTIANILLO A CHALLENGE AND THE REASON IS I HELPED GREAT DIGITAL TOOLS AND PROCESSES TO THE HELP OF TEAMS BUILD CARS AND VIDIO GAMES AND VISUAL EFFECTS A
TomWujec_2010U-0033857-0034512.wav AND WHAT THE MARSHMALLOW CHALLENGE DOES AS IT HELPS AND IDENTIFY THE HIDDEN ASSUMPTIONS BECAUSE FRANKLY
TomWujec_2010U-0034512-0036927.wav EVERY PROJECT HAS ITS OWN MARSHMALLOW ISN'T IT THAT THE CHALLENGE PROVIDES A SHARED EXPERIENCE A COMMON LANGUAGE A COMMON SENSE TO BUILD THE RIGHT PROTOTYPE AND SO THIS IS THE VALUE OF THE EXPERIENCE OF THIS SO SIMPLE EXERCISE AND THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE INTERESTED MAY ONE WHO GO TO MARSHMALLOW CHALLENGED OUR COMMENTS A BLOCK THAT YOU CAN LOOK AT HOW TO BUILD AT THE MARSHMALLOWS ARE STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS ON THIS A THERE ARE
TomWujec_2010U-0036927-0037543.wav CRAZY EXAMPLES FROM AROUND THE WORLD OF HOW PEOPLE WEAK AND ADJUSTLESS SYSTEM ITS WORLD RECORDS THAT ARE ON THIS AS WELL
TomWujec_2010U-0037543-0040217.wav AND THE FUNDAMENTAL LESSON I BELIEVE IS THAT DESIGN TRULY IS A CONTACT SPORT AH IT DEMANDS THAT WE BRING ALL OUR SENSES TO THE TASK AND THAT WE APPLY THE VERY BEST OF OUR THINKING OUR FEELING AND OUR DOING TO THE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE A AT HAND AND SOMETIMES A LITTLE PROTOTYPE OF THIS EXPERIENCE IS ALL THAT IT TAKES TO TURN US FROM A AN OHO MOMENT TO A TEDAR MOMENT AND THAT CAN MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE THANK YOU MUCH
