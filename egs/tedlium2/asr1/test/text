Using-Python-Modules-English_001_006 welcome to spoken tutorial on using patent models
Using-Python-Modules-English_006_022 in the studio you will learn to execute pipes and strips from command line use input in scripts and input lumpy and mathematical pipelines
Using-Python-Modules-English_022_040 to record the structural area i am using i'm going to learn that's sixteen points you know for operating system type and three point four point three i quiet times five point one point zero and j retixed ida
Using-Python-Modules-English_040_050 to practice this tutorial you should know how to use what interactively emblish unservable
Using-Python-Modules-English_050_055 if not sure the relevant patented areas on this website
Using-Python-Modules-English_055_058 first we will learn what is somebody
Using-Python-Modules-English_058_064 a model is a file containing quite a definition understatements
Using-Python-Modules-English_064_072 models are used to break them larger programs into small manageable and organized defies
Using-Python-Modules-English_072_079 definition from a model can be in ordered into other models or critical main model
Using-Python-Modules-English_079_084 now the decision occur on the piton script from common
Using-Python-Modules-English_084_093 walken united states to editor on type print inside breakfast inside the recourse hall
Using-Python-Modules-English_093_098 we have created a simple pilot instrument to print a logo
Using-Python-Modules-English_098_104 shape the strip as hello that be while in the current of working title
Using-Python-Modules-English_104_112 now it has opened the termina and then navigated to the directory where i love that the way it is safe
Using-Python-Modules-English_112_124 no type white entry hello betty white and treshed enter it egypt is stripped and it drifts to orkut as hello world
Using-Python-Modules-English_124_131 from here on was remember to press the entity as to type in every term on the tom
Using-Python-Modules-English_131_137 next google see how to input models and reduce them in pite and strip
Using-Python-Modules-English_137_143 yet we opened the fight so i understood that we were in the dirt
Using-Python-Modules-English_143_151 this fund is available in the code functioning of district orient you can download unusually
Using-Python-Modules-English_151_158 this quotable plot for yeats minor sets sign off its shine off
Using-Python-Modules-English_158_163 when we run this score we will see the final product as shown here
Using-Python-Modules-English_163_169 now let us grandify sam and the score club that we were as a prison script
Using-Python-Modules-English_169_175 type by country four understood where dutty
Using-Python-Modules-English_175_179 it gives an era in space it's not defined
Using-Python-Modules-English_179_185 it means that function in space is not available in the current name space
Using-Python-Modules-English_185_191 a name space is a system for making all the names in a program to be unique
Using-Python-Modules-English_191_196 it is good back to the financial understood progress
Using-Python-Modules-English_196_204 and this line as the first line in this clip from nampi in pakistan
Using-Python-Modules-English_204_212 when they use astrose in push all the functions and the constants are imported from lumpy model
Using-Python-Modules-English_212_216 in space is a function available in number
Using-Python-Modules-English_216_220 west controllers to save the fire
Using-Python-Modules-English_220_229 now let us run the stripper in now you give another name with a name cloak that is not designed
Using-Python-Modules-English_229_234 yet it took four understood clock that we were fighting again
Using-Python-Modules-English_234_244 i had the following as a certain one innovous strip from matt clock lipped dog pipe clock input astros
Using-Python-Modules-English_244_246 makes you different
Using-Python-Modules-English_246_252 plot is a function which is available in the map plot
Using-Python-Modules-English_252_259 we will run this trip again we did the opening
Using-Python-Modules-English_259_264 same portrait all the acquired models using the tube are important
Using-Python-Modules-English_264_268 let me close this window
Using-Python-Modules-English_268_277 we can import only functions which are required from a model of us from nampi in hope in space
Using-Python-Modules-English_277_284 instead of from number eight you put asters
Using-Python-Modules-English_284_299 in the same way we can import one day required functions from matchwork lipped or kipplock instead of from mattlock the door pipe block in photos
Using-Python-Modules-English_299_303 it is always good to use function names instead of
Using-Python-Modules-English_303_311 if they use our stories to import from a particular model all the functions will be important
Using-Python-Modules-English_311_317 it replaces some existing functions with the same name in the name space
Using-Python-Modules-English_317_325 now they would add wonder required functions from numpy and macrops lifted up by croc
Using-Python-Modules-English_325_327 let us shape to fight
Using-Python-Modules-English_327_332 we can run the code of an individual
Using-Python-Modules-English_332_340 yeah we got the blocks for its minus its sign off its and its single figure
Using-Python-Modules-English_340_346 in this method we encoded all the required functions to the current named space
Using-Python-Modules-English_346_351 there is another way of fixing errors yet it should
Using-Python-Modules-English_351_356 opened the file another understood fits
Using-Python-Modules-English_356_361 this film is also available in the core functioning of the structure
Using-Python-Modules-English_361_368 notice that we are going to use the name to yield the instrument of mark clock clip or clock
Using-Python-Modules-English_368_374 the answer is used as idiots to the modern magnet
Using-Python-Modules-English_374_382 now we used numbers that by instead of just to buy as we did in four understood cloud dirty way
Using-Python-Modules-English_382_403 what functions are told us physical clock creating doctors physical physical physical extreme physician and physical
Using-Python-Modules-English_403_411 that one teacher said function names in imported models do not get added to the current and in space
Using-Python-Modules-English_411_419 in order to use a function in an imported model we need to mention modern dog functioning
Using-Python-Modules-English_419_425 who still will do here try this exercise and then read
Using-Python-Modules-English_425_432 right a piton strip took quarter scientific from minus to pie two
Using-Python-Modules-English_432_447 opened the file signed up for the solution this file is also available in the order fashion in the faster than we incorporate the required functions
Using-Python-Modules-English_447_454 the functions in space sign and construct are incocred from the modern number
Using-Python-Modules-English_454_464 the import the functions crop legend show titled excel able and while able from my crook lived or piped up
Using-Python-Modules-English_464_468 and the rest of the orchestra generated too
Using-Python-Modules-English_468_472 let this trend accord and shoulder accord
Using-Python-Modules-English_472_478 in the terminal type by tree shinder
Using-Python-Modules-English_478_488 now we can see of a sun clock closed a communal they just move from their inever copy
Using-Python-Modules-English_488_493 we can run pitan strips in our patent interpreter also
Using-Python-Modules-English_493_502 woken another terminum and stopped an interpreter by typing high patent
Using-Python-Modules-English_502_515 now we get to the direction that four understood cloud that we were saved and type percentage run for understood not that we were
Using-Python-Modules-English_515_520 as before we can see the output with four croach
Using-Python-Modules-English_520_525 i think has a very rich standard library of models
Using-Python-Modules-English_525_541 some of the standard models short for math math random for internet access you are a little too yempty for system and command and arguments
Using-Python-Modules-English_541_560 few more libraries for operating system interface warriors for regular expression arguing for compression juice zip fight profile for more information refer to belonging
Using-Python-Modules-English_560_566 this drinks us to the end of the structure it is summer
Using-Python-Modules-English_566_578 in the studio we have designed two transcripts from command line import the modules by specifying the model needs followed by industries
Using-Python-Modules-English_578_587 input only the required functions from models by specifying the function in use prices standard naturally
Using-Python-Modules-English_587_602 here are some self assessment questions for you to solve first which among the below is the most correct second how the function excellent and wild can be encoded with a current name space
Using-Python-Modules-English_602_618 and the answers first the option from macho to pipot input cook is the most correct one because what is a function of matt brooklyn pipot model
Using-Python-Modules-English_618_632 second functions excellent and wild in canada empower to the current and inspace us from micropably dot pipe not import excellent common wiling
Using-Python-Modules-English_632_636 this close to a time of course in this form
Using-Python-Modules-English_636_641 this whole children's hot piton in this form
Using-Python-Modules-English_641_645 also to coordinate the tbc project
Using-Python-Modules-English_645_656 spoken contractorial culture is funded by anemia and a city emmer treaty a government official for more data visits
