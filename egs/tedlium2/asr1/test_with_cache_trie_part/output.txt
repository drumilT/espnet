GaryFlake_2010-0001605-0002712.wav BIT I CAN LEAVE YOU WITH ONE BIG IDEA TO DAY IT'S THAT THE WHOLE OF THE DATA IN WHICH WE CONSUME IS GREATER THAN THE SUM OF THE PARTS AND INSTEAD OF THINKING ABOUT INFORMATION OVERLOAD
GaryFlake_2010-0002712-0004072.wav WHAT I'D LIKE YOU TO THINK ABOUT IS HOW WE CAN USE INFORMATION TO THAT PATTERN'S POP AND WE CAN SEE TRINS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE INVISIBLE SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT RIGHT HERE IS A TYPICAL MORTALITY CHART ORGANIZED BY AGE THIS
GaryFlake_2010-0004072-0005245.wav TRUE THAT AMUSING HERE IS A LITTLE EXPERIMENT THAT'S CALLED PIVOT AND WITH PIVOT WHAT I CAN DO IS I CAN CHOOSE TO FILTER ON ONE PARTICULAR CAUSE OF DEBT SAY ACCIDENTS AND RIGHT AWAY I SEE THERE'S A DIFFERENT PATTERN THAT EMERGES
GaryFlake_2010-0005245-0006253.wav THIS IS BECAUSE IN THE MID AREA HERE PEOPLE AREA THEIR MOST ACTIVE AND OVERHEAR THERE THEY'RE MOST FRAIL WE CAN STEP BACK OUT AGAIN AND THEN REORGANIZE THE DATA BY CAUSE OF DEATH
GaryFlake_2010-0006253-0007070.wav SEEING THAT CIRCULATORY DISEASES AND CANCERBS ARE THE USUAL SUSPECTS BUT NOT FOR EVERY ONE IF WE GO AHEAD AND WE FILCH HER
GaryFlake_2010-0007070-0007797.wav BIT AGE SAY FORTY YEARS OR LESS WE SEE THAT ACCIDENTS ARE ACTUALLY THE GREATEST CAUSE THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO BE WORRIED ABOUT
GaryFlake_2010-0007797-0008762.wav AND WE DROVE TO THAT IT'S ESPECIALLY THE CASE FOR MAT SO YOU GET THE IDEA THAT VIEWING INFORMATION VIEWING DATE IN THIS WAY IS A LOT LIKE
GaryFlake_2010-0008762-0009589.wav SWIMMING BIT AN LIVING INFORMATION INHOGRAPHIC AND IF WE CAN DO THIS FOR RAW DATA WHY NOT DO IT FOR CONTENT AS WELL
GaryFlake_2010-0009589-0010306.wav BIT SO WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT HERE IS THE COVER OF EVERY SINGLE SPORTS ILLUSTRATED EVER PRODUCED
GaryFlake_2010-0010306-0011591.wav BIT IT'S ALL HERE IT'S ALL IN THE WEB YOU CAN GO BACK YOUR ROOMS AND TRY THIS AFTER MY TALK WITH PIVOT YOU CAN DRILL INTO A DECADE YOU CAN DRILL INTO A PARTICULAR YEAR YOU CAN JUMP RIGHT INTO A SPECIFIC ISSUE

GaryFlake_2010-0015469-0018126.wav WE THINK IT CHANGES THE WAY INFORMATION CAN BE USED SO OWN EXTRAPULATE ON THIS IDEA BIT WITH SOMETHING OF THE LITTLE BIT CRAZY WHAT WE'VE DONE HERE IS WE'VE TAKEN EVERY SINGLE WICKET OF PAGE AND WE REDUCED IT DOWN TO A LITTLE SUMMARY SO THE SUMMARY CONSISTED OF JUST LITTLE SYNOPSIS AND THE ICON TO INDICATE THE TOPICAL AREA THAT IT COMES FROM I'M ONLY SHOWING THE TOP FIVE HUNDRED MOST POPULAR WICKAPETIA PAGES STRAIGHT HERE BITE' BUT EVEN IN BITE'STIC VIEW THE TOPICAL AREA THAT IT BITE YOU

GaryFlake_2010-0031869-0032556.wav REPURP IS MULTIPLE TIMES AND IN EACH CASE IT MAKES THE WHOLE GREATER THAN THE SUM OF THE PARTS WITH THE DATA SO
GaryFlake_2010-0032556-0033425.wav RIGHT NOW IN THIS WORLD WE THINK ABOUT DATA AS BEING THIS CURSE WE TALK ABOUT THE CURSE OF INFORMATION OVERLOAD WE TALK ABOUT
GaryFlake_2010-0033425-0033991.wav DROWNING IN DATA WHAT IF WE CAN ACTUALLY TURN THAT UPSIDE DOWN AND TURN THE WEB UPSIDE DOWN
GaryFlake_2010-0033991-0035282.wav SO BIT INSTEAD OF NAVIGATING FROM ONE THING TO THE NEXT WE GET USED TO THE HABIT OF BEING ABLE TO GO FROM MANY THINGS TO MANY THINGS AND THEN BEING ABLE TO SEE THE PATTERNS THAT WE'RE OTHERWISE HID IT IF WE CAN DO THAT THEN INSTEAD
GaryFlake_2010-0035282-0036714.wav OF BEING TRACT AND DATA WE MIGHT ACTUALLY EXTRACT INFORMATION AND INSTEAD OF DEALING JUST WITH INFORMATION WE CAN TEASE OUT KNOWLEDGE AND IF WE GET THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE MAY BE THESE FROM THERE'S WISDOM TO BE FOUND SO THAT I THANK YOU

TomWujec_2010U-0004156-0004920.wav AND OH I THOUGHT THIS WAS AN INTERESTING IDEA AND I INCORPORATED INTO A DESIGNED WORKSHOP AND IT WAS A HUGE SUCCESS AND SINCE THEN I'VE
TomWujec_2010U-0004920-0006666.wav CONDUCTED ALONG SEVENTY DESIGN WORKSHOPS ALONG THE WORLD WITH STUDENTS AND DESIGN OH AS AN ARCHITECTS EVEN THE SCITIOS OF THE FORTUNE FIFTY AND THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THIS EXERCISE THAT REVEALS VERY DEEP LESSONS ABOUT THE NATURE OF COLLABORATION AND I'D LIKE TO SHARE SOME OF THEM WITH YOU SO DAH OH OH I'VE OHS OHE'S OH OHS OH
TomWujec_2010U-0006666-0008700.wav NORMALLY MOST PEOPLE BEGIN BY ORIENTING THEMSELVES TO THE TASK THEY TALK ABOUT IT THEY FIGURE AT WHAT IS GOING A LOOK LIKE THEY JOCKEY FOR POWER THEN THEY SPEND SOME TIME PLANNING ORGANIZING THEY SKETCH IN THEY LAY OUTS FORGETTY AH THEY'D SPEND THE MAJORITY OF THEIR TIME ASSEMBLING THE STICKS INTO EVER GROWING STRUCTURES AND THEN
TomWujec_2010U-0008700-0009587.wav FINALLY OH JUST AS THEY'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME SOME ONE TAKES OUT THE MARSHMALLOW AND THEN THEY GINGERLY PUT IT ON TOP AND THEY STAND BACK

TomWujec_2010U-0009748-0010954.wav THEY OH ADMIRE THEIR WORK BUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENS MOST THE TIME IS THAT THE DADDAD TURNS INTO AN OH CAUSE THE WEIGHT OF THE MARSHMALLOW CAUSES THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE TO BUCKLE AND TO COLLAPSE SO IF THE DAD DAD DAD'S TOE OH
TomWujec_2010U-0010954-0011682.wav THERE ARE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO'D HAVE A LOT MORE OH OH MOMENTS THAN OTHERS AND ALONG THE WORST ARE RECENT GRADUATES OF BUSINESS SCHOOL

TomWujec_2010U-0013481-0014491.wav OH PRETTY AMAZING AS PETER TELLS US OH NOT ONLY THAT IT DO THEY PRODUCE THE TALLEST STRUCTURES BUT THAT THE MOST INTERESTING STRUCTURES OF THEM ALL SO THE QUESTION HE WHEN ASK IS HELCOMBE
TomWujec_2010U-0014491-0015269.wav WHY OH WHAT IS IT ABOUT THEM AND PETER LIKES TO SAY THAT NONE OF THE SKIN UNDER THE KIDS SPEND ANY TIME TRYING TO BE SEA EELS PICKETY INK
TomWujec_2010U-0015269-0016219.wav OH RIGHT THEY DON'T TIME IT SPEND TIME JOCKING FOR PART BUT THERE'S ANOTHER REASON IS WELL AND THE REASON IS THAT BUSINESS STUDENTS ARE TRAINED TO FIND THE SINGLE RIGHT PLAN
TomWujec_2010U-0016219-0016949.wav RIGHT AND THEN THEY EXECUTE ON IT AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS WHEN THEY PUT THE MARSHMALLOW ALONG TOP THEY RUN OUT OF TIME AND WHAT HAPPENS IT'S A CRISIS
TomWujec_2010U-0017131-0017995.wav SOUND FAMILIAR RIGHT OH WHAT KINDER GARDENERS DO DIFFERENTLY IS THAT THEY START WITH THE MARSHMALLOW AND THEY BUILD PROTOTYPE'S SUCCESSIVE PROTOTYPES
TomWujec_2010U-0017995-0018863.wav ALWAYS KEEPING THE MARSHMALLOW ALONG TOPS OF THEY OF MULTIPLE TIMES ADD TO TO FIX IN A BUILT PROTOTYPES ALONG THE WAY SO AS VINER'S RECOGNISED THIS TYPE OF COLLABORATION
TomWujec_2010U-0018863-0019612.wav OH THE ESSENCE OF THE IDERATIVE PROCESS AND WITH EACH VERSION KIDS GET INSTANT FEE BACK ABOUT WHAT WORKS AND WHAT DOESN'T WORK

TomWujec_2010U-0022235-0023455.wav THIRTY NINE INCHES OH TALLEST STRUCTURE AH I'VE SEEN AND WHY IS IT BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND TRIANGLES AND SELF REINFORCING GEOMETRICAL PATTERNS OR THE KEY TO BUILDING SELF A REINFORCE AT THIS STABLE STRUCTURES
TomWujec_2010U-0023455-0024381.wav SO I SEE OHS LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN AVERAGE BUT HERES WHERE GETS INTERESTING IF YOU PUT IN EXECUTIVE ADMIN ON THE TEAMS THEY GET SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER OHS OH'S SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER DAD DAD DAD'S I'M SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER DADDER

TomWujec_2010U-0031142-0032519.wav ALONG THE SAME TEAM WENT FROM BEING THE VERY WORST TO BEING ALONG THE VERY BEST THEY PRODUCED THE TALLEST STRUCTURES IN THE LEAST AMOUNT OF TIME OH THERE'S A RE DEEP LESSON'S FOR US ABOUT THE NATURE OF INCENTIVES AND SUCCESS OH OH OH A OHD OH A OHD OHES OH A SUCCESS
TomWujec_2010U-0032519-0033857.wav OH YOU MIGHT ASK WHY WOULD ANYONE ACTUALLY SPEND TIME RUNNING A MARSHMALLOW A CHALLENGE OH THE REASON IS I HELPED GREAT DESERTAL TOOLS AND PROCESSES TO THE HELP OF TEAMS BUILD CARS AND VIDIO GAMES AND VISUAL EFFECTS AY OH OH' OH'M OH'S OH
