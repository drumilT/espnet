AimeeMullins_2009P-0001782-0002881.wav I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU A DISCOVERY THAT I MADE A FEW MONTHS AGO WHILE WRITING AN ARTICLE FOR ITALIAN WIRED I ALWAYS KEEP MY CZAR AS HANDY I'M WRITING ANYTHING BUT
AimeeMullins_2009P-0002881-0004026.wav I HAD ALREADY FINISHED EDITING THE PIECE AND I REALIZED THAT I HAD NEVER ONCE IN MY LIFE LOOKED UP THE WORD DISABLED TO SEE WHAT I FIND LET ME READ YOU THE ENTRY

AimeeMullins_2009P-0008632-0009505.wav I WAS READING THIS LIST OUT LOUD TO A FRIEND AND AT FIRST WAS LAUGHING IT WAS SO LUDICROUS BUT I JUST GOT PAST MANGLED
AimeeMullins_2009P-0009505-0010405.wav MY VOICE BROKE AND I HAD TO STOP AND COLLECT MYSELF FROM THE EMOTIONAL SHOCK
AimeeMullins_2009P-0010430-0010973.wav AH AN IMPACT OF THE ASSAULT FROM THESE WORDS UNLOCKED
AimeeMullins_2009P-0010973-0012123.wav I KNOW I'M OF COURSE THIS IS MY RAGGEDY OLD BAZAAR I'M THINKING THIS MUST BE AN ANCIENT PRINTED RIGHT BUT IN FACT APPRENTICE WAS THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY
AimeeMullins_2009P-0012123-0013544.wav WHEN I WOULD HAVE BEEN THE STARTING PRIMARY SCHOOL IN FORMING AN UNDERSTANDING OF MYSELF OUTSIDE THE FAMILY UNIT AND AS RELATED TO THE OTHER KIDS IN THE WORLD AROUND ME AND NEEDLESS TO SAY THANK GOD I WASN'T USING IT THE SOREST BACK THEN
AimeeMullins_2009P-0013544-0014951.wav I MEAN FROM THIS ENTRY IT WOULD SEEM THAT I WAS BORN INTO A WORLD THAT PERCEIVED SOME ONE LIKE ME TO HAVE NOTHING POSITIVE WHATSOEVER GOING FOR THEM WHEN IN FACT
AimeeMullins_2009P-0014951-0015866.wav I AM CELEBRATED FOR THE OPPORTUNITIES AND ADVENTURES MY LIFE HAVE PROCURED SO AM I IMMEDIATELY
AimeeMullins_2009P-0015866-0016844.wav WENT TO LOOK AT THE TWO THOUSAND NINE ON LINE EDITION EXPECTING TO FIND A REVISION WORTH NOTING HERE'S THE UPDATED VERSION OF THIS ENTRY
AimeeMullins_2009P-0016844-0018066.wav FORTUNATELY IT'S NOT MUCH BETTER I FIND THAT THE LAST TWO WORDS UNDER NEAR ANTONYMS PARTICULARLY UNSETTLING WHOLE AND WHOLESOME
AimeeMullins_2009P-0018227-0018484.wav SO IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE WORDS
AimeeMullins_2009P-0018484-0019618.wav IT'S WHAT WE BELIEVE ABOUT PEOPLE WHEN WE NAME THEM WITH THESE WORDS ABOUT THE VALUES BEHIND THE WORDS AND HOW WE CONSTRUCT THOSE VALUES OUR LANGUAGE AFFECTS OUR THINKING
AimeeMullins_2009P-0019618-0020658.wav AND HOW WE VIEW THE WORLD AND HOW WE VIEW OTHER PEOPLE IN FACT MANY ANCIENT SOCIETIES INCLUDING THE GREEKS AND ROMANS BELIEVED THAT TO UTTER A CURSE
AimeeMullins_2009P-0020658-0021408.wav VERBALLY WAS SO POWERFUL BECAUSE TO SAY THE THING OUT LOUD BROUGHT IT INTO EXISTENCE
AimeeMullins_2009P-0021558-0022537.wav SO WHAT REALITY DO WE WANT TO CALL INTO EXISTENCE A PERSON WHO IS LIMITED OR A PERSON WHO IS EMPOWERED
AimeeMullins_2009P-0022596-0023219.wav BY CASUALLY DOING SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS NAMING A PERSON A CHILD
AimeeMullins_2009P-0023219-0024260.wav WE MIGHT BE PUTTING LIDS AND CASTING SHADOWS ON THEIR POWER WOULDN'T WE WANT TO OPEN DOORS FOR THEM INSTEAD
AimeeMullins_2009P-0024260-0025318.wav ONCE A PERSON WHO OPENED DOORS FOR ME WAS MY CHILDHOOD DOCTOR AT THE A I DUPONT INSTITUTE IN WILMINGTON DELAWARE HIS NAME IS DOCTOR PETTITILLO
AimeeMullins_2009P-0025318-0026172.wav A M AN ITALIAN AMERICAN WHOSE NAME APPARENTLY WAS TOO DIFFICULT FOR MOST AMERICANS TO PRONOUNCE SO HE WENT BY DOCTOR P AND DOCTOR P
AimeeMullins_2009P-0026172-0026922.wav ALWAYS WERE REALLY COLORFUL BEAUTIES AND HAD THE VERY PERFECT DISPOSITION TO WORK WITH CHILDREN
AimeeMullins_2009P-0026922-0027863.wav I LOVED ALMOST EVERYTHING ABOUT MY TIME SPENT AT THIS HOSPITAL WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MY PHYSICAL FARE
AimeeMullins_2009P-0027863-0028948.wav I HAD TO DO WHAT SEEMED LIKE INNUMERABLE REPETITIONS OF EXERCISES WITH THESE THICK ELASTIC BANDS OF DIFFERENT COLORS
AimeeMullins_2009P-0028948-0029689.wav TO HELP BUILD UP MY LEG MUSCLES AND I HATED THESE BANDS MORE THAN ANYTHING I HATED THEM HAD NAMED THEM I HATED THEM AND
AimeeMullins_2009P-0029689-0030481.wav NO I WAS ALREADY BARGAINING AT THE FIVE YEAR OLD CHILD WITH DOCTOR P TO TRY TO GET OUT OF DOING THESE EXERCISES UNSUCCESSFULLY OF COURSE
AimeeMullins_2009P-0030481-0031277.wav AND ONE DAY HE CAME IN TO MY SESSION M EXHAUSTIVE AND UNFORGIVING
AimeeMullins_2009P-0031277-0032020.wav AND HE SAID TO ME WELL AMY YOU ARE SUCH A STRONG POWERFUL LITTLE GIRL
AimeeMullins_2009P-0032020-0032956.wav I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO BREAK ONE OF THOSE BANDS WHEN YOU DO BREAK IN I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A HUNDRED BOX NOW COURSE THIS WAS A SIMPLE EMPLOYE
AimeeMullins_2009P-0032956-0033802.wav ON DOCTOR'S PART TO GET ME TO DO THE EXERCISE THAT I DIDN'T WANT TO DO BEFORE THE PROSPECT OF BEING THE RICHEST FIVE YEAR OLD IN THE SECOND FLOOR WARD
AimeeMullins_2009P-0033802-0034947.wav BUT WHAT HE EFFECTIVELY DID FOR ME WAS RESHAPE AN AWFUL DAILY OCCURRENCE INTO A NEW AND PROMISING EXPERIENCE FOR ME
AimeeMullins_2009P-0034947-0035686.wav AND I HAVE TO WONDER TODAY TO WHAT EXTENT HIS VISION AND HIS DECLARATION OF ME
AimeeMullins_2009P-0035686-0036783.wav AS A STRONG AND POWERFUL LITTLE GIRL MY OWN VIEW OF MYSELF AS AN INHERENTLY STRONG POWERFUL AND ATHLETIC PERSON WELL INTO THE FUTURE
AimeeMullins_2009P-0036783-0037485.wav THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW ADULTS IN POSITIONS OF POWER CAN UNITE THE POWER OF A CHILD
AimeeMullins_2009P-0037485-0038551.wav BUT IN THE PREVIOUS INSTANCES OF THOSE CASSARIS ENTRY IN OUR LANGUAGE ISN'T ALLOWING US TO EVOLVE INTO THE REALITY THAT WE WOULD ALL WANT
AimeeMullins_2009P-0038551-0039101.wav THE POSSIBILITY OF AN INDIVIDUAL TO SEE THEMSELVES AS CAPABLE
AimeeMullins_2009P-0039227-0040235.wav OUR LANGUAGE HAS BEEN CAUGHT UP WITH THE CHANGES IN OUR SOCIETY MANY OF WHICH HAVE BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT BY TECHNOLOGY CERTAINLY FROM A MEDICAL STANDPOINT
AimeeMullins_2009P-0040235-0041940.wav MY LEGS AH YOU KNOW LAZAR SURGERY FOR A BUSINESS IMPAIRMENT A TITANIUM KNEES AND HIP REPLACEMENTS FOR AGING BODIES THAT ARE ALLOWING PEOPLE TO MORE FULLY ENGAGED WITH THEIR ABILITIES AND MOVE BEYOND THE LIMITS THAT NATURE IMPOSED ON THEM
AimeeMullins_2009P-0041940-0043192.wav NOT TO MENTION SOCIAL NETWORKING PLATFORMS ALLOWS PEOPLE TO SELF IDENTIFY TO CLAIM THEIR OWN DESCRIPTIONS OF THEMSELVES SO THEY CAN GO A LINE WITH LOCAL GROUPS OF THEIR OWN CHOOSING
AimeeMullins_2009P-0043323-0044675.wav SO PERHAPS ACKNOWLEDGES REVEALING MORE CLEARLY TO US NOW WHAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A TRUTH THAT EVERY ONE HAS SOMETHING RARE AND POWERFUL TO OFFER OUR SOCIETY
AimeeMullins_2009P-0044776-0045808.wav AND THAT THE HUMAN ABILITY TO ADAPT IS OUR GREATEST ASSET A HUMAN ABILITY TO ADAPT AN INTERESTING THING BECAUSE PEOPLE
AimeeMullins_2009P-0045808-0046227.wav HAVE CONTINUALLY WANTED TO TALK TO ME ABOUT OVERCOMING UNIVERSITY
AimeeMullins_2009P-0046227-0047443.wav AN OMINOUS MAKE AN ADMISSION THIS PHRASE NEVER SAT RIGHT WITH ME AND I ALWAYS FELT UNEASY TRYING TO ANSWER PEOPLE'S QUESTIONS ABOUT IT AND I THINK I'M STARTING TO FIGURE OUT WHY
AimeeMullins_2009P-0047443-0048316.wav IMPLICIT IN THIS PHRASE OF OVERCOMING ADVERSITY IS THE IDEA THAT SUCCESS OR HAPPINESS
AimeeMullins_2009P-0048316-0049171.wav IS ABOUT EMERGING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF A CHALLENGING EXPERIENCE UNSCATHED OR UNMARKED BY THE EXPERIENCE
AimeeMullins_2009P-0049171-0050267.wav AS IF MY SUCCESSES IN LIFE HAD COME ABOUT FROM AN ABILITY TO SIDE STEP OR CIRCUMNAVIGATE THE PRESUMED PITFALLS OF A LIFE WITH PROPHETICS AND WHAT OTHER PEOPLE PERCEIVE IS MY DISABILITY
AimeeMullins_2009P-0050267-0051512.wav BUT IN FACT WE ARE CHANGED WE ARE MARKED OF COURSE BY A CHALLENGE WHETHER PHYSICALLY EMOTIONALLY OR BOTH AN OMINOUS SUGGESTION THIS IS A GOOD THING
AimeeMullins_2009P-0051512-0052435.wav ADVERSITY IS AN OBSTACLE THAT WE NEED TO GET AROUND IN ORDER TO RESUME LIVING OUR LIFE IT'S PART OF OUR LIFE
AimeeMullins_2009P-0052435-0053316.wav AND I CANNOT THINK OF IT LIKE MY SHADOW SOMETIMES I SEE A LOT OF IT SOMETIMES THERE'S VERY LITTLE BUT IT'S ALWAYS WITH ME
AimeeMullins_2009P-0053316-0054135.wav CERTAINLY I AM NOT TRYING TO DIMINISH THE IMPACT THE WEIGHT OF A PERSON'S STRUGGLE THERE IS
AimeeMullins_2009P-0054135-0055215.wav ADVERSITY AND CHALLENGE IN LIFE AND IS ALL VERY REAL AND RELATIVE TO EVERY SINGLE PERSON BUT THE QUESTION ISN'T WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE GOING TO MEET ADVERSITY BUT HOW YOU'RE GOING TO MEET IT
AimeeMullins_2009P-0055215-0056279.wav SO OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS NOT SIMPLY SHIELDING THOSE WE CARE FOR FROM ADVERSITY BUT PREPARING THEM TO MEET IT WELL
AimeeMullins_2009P-0056279-0057375.wav AND WE DO IT TO SERVICE TO OUR KIDS WHEN WE MAKE THEM FEEL THAT THEY ARE NOT EQUIPPED TO ADAPT
AimeeMullins_2009P-0057375-0058754.wav THERE IS AN IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE AND DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE OBJECTIVE MEDICAL FACT OF MY BEING AN APUTY AND THE SUBJECTIVE SUICIDAL OPINION OF WHETHER OR NOT I AM DISABLED
AimeeMullins_2009P-0058754-0059916.wav AND TRUTHFULLY THE ONLY REAL AND CONSISTENT DISABILITY I'VE HAD TO CONFRONT IS THE WORLD EVER THINKING I COULD BE DESCRIBED BY THOSE DEFINITIONS
AimeeMullins_2009P-0059916-0060664.wav IN OUR DESIRE TO PROTECT THOSE WE CARE ABOUT BY GIVING THEM THE COLD HARD TRUTH ABOUT THEIR MEDICAL PRACTICES
AimeeMullins_2009P-0060664-0061624.wav OR INDEED A PROGNOSIS ON THE EXPECTED QUALITY OF THEIR LIFE WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T PUT THE FIRST BRICK IN A WALL THAT WILL ACTUALLY
AimeeMullins_2009P-0061624-0062591.wav DISABLE SOMEONE PERHAPS THE EXISTING MODEL OF ONLY LOOKING AT WHAT IS BROKEN IN YOU AND HOW DO WE FIX IT
AimeeMullins_2009P-0062591-0063563.wav SERVE TO BE MORE DISABLING TO THE INDIVIDUAL THAN THE PATHOLOGY ITSELF BY NOT TREATING THE WHOLENESS OF A PERSON
AimeeMullins_2009P-0063563-0064440.wav BY NOT ACKNOWLEDGING THEIR POTENCY WE ARE CREATING ANOTHER ILL ON TOP OF WHATEVER NATURAL STRUGGLE THEY MIGHT HAVE
AimeeMullins_2009P-0064440-0065937.wav WE ARE EFFECTIVELY GRATING SOMEONE'S WORTH TO OUR COMMUNITY SO WE NEED TO SEE THROUGH THE PATHOLOGY AND INTO THE RANGE OF HUMAN CAPABILITY
AimeeMullins_2009P-0065937-0066929.wav AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THERE IS A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THOSE PERCEIVED DEFICIENCIES AND OUR GREATEST CREATIVE ABILITY
AimeeMullins_2009P-0066929-0068108.wav SO IT'S NOT ABOUT DEVOURING OR NEGATING THESE MORE TRYING TIMES AS SOMETHING WE WANT TO AVOID OR SWEEP UNDER THE RUG BUT INSTEAD TO FIND THOSE OPPORTUNITIES
AimeeMullins_2009P-0068108-0069370.wav RAT IN THE ADVERSITY SO MAYBE THE IDEA I WANT TO PUT OUT THERE IS NOT SO MUCH OVERCOMING ADVERSITY AS IT IS OPENING OURSELVES UP TO IT
AimeeMullins_2009P-0069586-0070401.wav EMBRACING IT GRAPPLING WITH IT AS A RUSTLING TERM MAY BE EVEN DANCING WITH IT
AimeeMullins_2009P-0070569-0071687.wav AND PERHAPS IF WE SEE ADVERSITY AS NATURAL CONSISTENT AND USEFUL WERE LESS BURDENED BY THE PRESENCE OF IT
AimeeMullins_2009P-0071687-0072903.wav THIS YEAR WE CELEBRATE THE TWO HUNDRED BIRTHDAY OF CHARLES DARWIN AND IT WAS A HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO WHEN WRITING ABOUT EVOLUTION THE DARWIN ILLUSTRATED I THINK A TRUTH ABOUT THE HUMAN CHARACTER
AimeeMullins_2009P-0072903-0074110.wav TO PARAPHRASE IT'S NOT THE STRONGEST OF THE SPECIES THAT SURVIVES NOR IS IT THE MOST INTELLIGENT THAT SURVIVES IT IS THE ONE THAT IS MOST ADAPTABLE TO CHANGE
AimeeMullins_2009P-0074110-0075391.wav CONFLICT IS THE GENESIS OF CREATION FROM DARWIN'S WORK AMONG WE CAN RECOGNIZE THAT THE HUMAN ABILITY TO SURVIVE AND FLOURISH
AimeeMullins_2009P-0075391-0076587.wav IS DRIVEN BY THE STRUGGLE OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT THROUGH CONFLICT INTO TRANSFORMATION SO AGAIN TRANSFORMATION ADAPTATION IS OUR GREATEST
AimeeMullins_2009P-0076587-0077977.wav HUMAN SKILL AND PERHAPS YOU KNOW UNTIL WE'RE TESTED WE DON'T KNOW WE'RE MADE OF MAYBE THAT OF ADVERSITY GIVES US A SENSE OF SELF A SENSE OF OUR OWN POWER
AimeeMullins_2009P-0077977-0079016.wav SO WE CAN GIVE OURSELVES A GIFT WE CAN IMAGINE ADVERSITY AS SOMETHING MORE THAN JUST TOUGH TIMES
AimeeMullins_2009P-0079016-0079872.wav MAYBE WE CAN SEE IT IS CHANGE ADVERSITY IS JUST CHANGE THAT WE HAVEN'T ADAPTED OURSELVES TO YET
AimeeMullins_2009P-0079872-0080438.wav I THINK THE GREATEST ADVERSITY THAT WE'VE CREATED FOR OURSELVES IS THIS IDEA OF NORMALCY
AimeeMullins_2009P-0080438-0081166.wav WHO IS NORMAL THERE'S NO NORMAL THERE'S COMMON THERE'S TYPICAL
AimeeMullins_2009P-0081166-0082197.wav THERE'S NO NORMAL AND WOULD YOU WANT TO MEET THAT POOR BAGED PERSON IF THEY EXISTED I'LL THINK SO IF WE CAN CHANGE THIS PARADISE FROM ONE OF
AimeeMullins_2009P-0082197-0083509.wav ACHIEVING NORMALLY TO ONE OF POSSIBILITY OR POTENCY TO BE EVEN MORE DANGEROUS WE CAN RELEASE THE POWER OF SO MANY MORE CHILDREN AND INVITE THEM TO ENGAGE
AimeeMullins_2009P-0083509-0084925.wav THEIR RARE AND VALUABLE ABILITIES WITH THE COMMUNITY ANTHROPOLOGIST TELL US THAT THE ONE THING WE AS HUMANS HAVE ALWAYS REQUIRED OF OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS IS TO BE OF USE TO BE ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE
AimeeMullins_2009P-0084925-0085968.wav THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT NEANDERTHALS SIXTY THOUSAND YEARS AGO CARRIED THEIR ELDERLY AND THOSE WITH SERIOUS PHYSICAL INJURY
AimeeMullins_2009P-0085968-0086886.wav AND PERHAPS IT IS BECAUSE THE LIFE EXPERIENCE OF SURVIVAL OF THESE PEOPLE PROVED A VALUE TO THE COMMUNITY
AimeeMullins_2009P-0086886-0087684.wav THEY DIDN'T VIEW THESE PEOPLE AS BROKEN AND USELESS THEY WERE SEEN AS RARE AND VALUABLE
AimeeMullins_2009P-0087684-0088306.wav THREE YEARS AGO I WAS IN A FOOD MARKET IN THE TOWN WHERE I GREW UP IN THAT RED ZONE IN NORTH EASTERN PENNSYLVANIA
AimeeMullins_2009P-0088306-0089205.wav AND I WAS STANDING OVER A BUSHEL OF TOMATOES IT WAS SUMMER TIME I HAD SHORTS ON I HEARD THE GUY HIS VOICE BEHIND ME SAY WELL IF IT ISN'T AIMED AT MULLINS
AimeeMullins_2009P-0089205-0089905.wav I TURN ROUND AND IS HIS OLDER MAN I HAVE NO IDEA WHO HE IS AND I SAID I I'M SORRY SIR I DON'T
AimeeMullins_2009P-0089905-0090720.wav HAD WE MET I DON'T REMEMBER MEETING YOU HE SAID WHAT YOU WOULD REMEMBER MEETING ME WHEN WHEN WE MET I WAS DELIVERING YOU FROM YOUR MOTHER'S ROOM
AimeeMullins_2009P-0090720-0091363.wav OH THAT GUY IF YOU LIKE AND OF COURSE ACTUALLY
AimeeMullins_2009P-0091363-0092262.wav IT DID CLICK THIS MAN WAS DOCTOR KING A MAN THAT I HAD ONLY KNOWN ABOUT THROUGH MY MOTHER'S STORIES OF THAT DAY BECAUSE OF COURSE
AimeeMullins_2009P-0092262-0093565.wav TYPICAL FASHION I ARRIVED LATE FOR MY BIRTHDAY BY TWO WEEKS AND SO MY MOTHER'S PRENATAL PHYSICIAN HAD GONE IN OCCASION SO THE MAN WHO DELIVERED ME WAS A COMPLETE STRANGER TO MY PARENTS
AimeeMullins_2009P-0093565-0094478.wav AND BECAUSE I WAS BORN ABOUT THE STABLE OF BONES AND HAD FEET TURNED IN AND A FEW TOES IN THIS FOOT AND A FEW TOES IN THAT HE HAD TO BE THE BEARER THE STRANGER
AimeeMullins_2009P-0094478-0095339.wav HAD TO BE THE BEARER OF BAD NEWS HE SAID TO ME I HAD TO GIVE THIS PROGNOSIS TO YOUR PARENTS THAT YOU WOULD NEVER WALK
AimeeMullins_2009P-0095339-0096121.wav AND YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE THE KIND OF MOBILITY THAT COULD HAVE OR ANY KIND OF LIFE OF INDEPENDENCE AND YOU'VE BEEN MAKING A LIAR OUT OF ME EVER SINCE
AimeeMullins_2009P-0096939-0097577.wav THE EXTRAORDINARY THING IS THAT HE SAID HE HAD SAVED NEWSPAPER CLIPPING THROUGHOUT MY WHOLE CHILDHOOD
AimeeMullins_2009P-0097577-0098593.wav WHETHER WINNING A SECOND GREAT SPELLING BEE MARCHING WITH THE GIRL SCOWLS AND OUT OF THE HOLLOWING PARADE WINNING MY COLLEGE SCHOLARSHIP OR ANY OF MY SPORTS VICTORIES
AimeeMullins_2009P-0098593-0099417.wav AND HE WAS USING IT AND INTEGRATING IT INTO TEACHING A RESIDENT STUDENTS MET STUDENTS FROM HONAN
AimeeMullins_2009P-0099417-0100299.wav MEDICAL SCHOOL AND HERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL AND HE CALLED THIS PART OF THE COURSE THE FACTOR THERE IS THE POTENTIAL OF THE HUMAN WILL
AimeeMullins_2009P-0100299-0101128.wav NO PROGNOSIS CAN ACCOUNT FOR HOW POWERFUL THIS COULD BE IN THE DETERMINATE IN THE QUALITY OF SOMEONE'S LIFE
AimeeMullins_2009P-0101128-0102204.wav AND DOCTOR KING WENT ON TO TELL ME THAT HE SAID IN MY EXPERIENCE UNLESS REPEATEDLY TOLD OTHERWISE
AimeeMullins_2009P-0102204-0103166.wav AND EVEN IF GIVEN A MODICUM OF SUPPORT IF LEFT TO THEIR OWN DEVICES A CHILD WILL ACHIEVE
AimeeMullins_2009P-0103166-0104197.wav DOCTOR KEENE MADE THAT SHIFT AND THINKING HE UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MEDICAL CONDITION AND WHAT SOMEONE MIGHT DO WITH IT
AimeeMullins_2009P-0104197-0105578.wav THERE'S BEEN A SHIFT IN MY THINKING OVERTIME AND THAT IF YOU'D ASKED ME AT FIFTEEN YEARS OLD IF I WOULD HAVE TRADED PROPHETICS FOR FLESH AND BONE LEGS I WOULDN'T HAVE HESITATED A SECOND
AimeeMullins_2009P-0105578-0106539.wav I ASPIRED TO THAT KIND OF NORMALCY BACK THEN WOULD YOU ASK ME TO DAY I AM NOT SO SURE
AimeeMullins_2009P-0106539-0107571.wav AND IT'S BECAUSE OF THE EXPERIENCES I'VE HAD WITH THEM NOT IN SPITE OF THE EXPERIENCES I'VE HAD WITH THEM
AimeeMullins_2009P-0107571-0109070.wav AND PERHAPS THIS SHIFT IN ME HAS HAPPENED BECAUSE I'VE BEEN EXPOSED TO MORE PEOPLE WHO HAVE OPENED DOORS FOR ME THAN THOSE WHO HAVE PUT LIDS AND CAST SHADOWS ON ME
AimeeMullins_2009P-0109070-0110170.wav ALL YOU REALLY NEED IS ONE PERSON TO SHOW YOU THE EPIPHANY OF YOUR OWN POWER AND YOU'RE OFF IF YOU CAN HAND SOMEBODY THE KEY
AimeeMullins_2009P-0110170-0111240.wav TO THEIR OWN POWER THE HUMAN SPIRIT IS SO RECEPTIVE IF YOU CAN DO THAT AND OPEN A DOOR FOR SOMEONE AT A CRUCIAL MOMENT YOU ARE EDUCATING THEM IN THE BEST SENSE
AimeeMullins_2009P-0111240-0112174.wav YOUR TEACHING THEM TO OPEN DOORS FOR THEMSELVES IN FACT THE EXACT MEANING OF THE WORD EDUCATE
AimeeMullins_2009P-0112174-0113360.wav COMES FROM THE ROOT WORD DEUCE IT MEANS TO BRING FORTH WHAT IS WITHIN TO BRING OUT POTENTIAL SO AGAIN WHICH POTENTIAL DO WE WANT TO BRING OUT
AimeeMullins_2009P-0113542-0114566.wav THERE WAS A CASE THAT HE DONE IN NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN WHEN THEY WERE MOVING FROM COMPREHENSIVE GRAMMAR SCHOOLS TO COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOLS THAT CALLED THE STREAMING TRIALS WE CALL IT TRACKING
AimeeMullins_2009P-0114566-0115107.wav HERE IN THE STATES SEPARATING STUDENTS FROM A B C D SO ON
AimeeMullins_2009P-0115107-0116565.wav AND NOW THE AESOONS GET THE TOP A CRIKULUM THE BEST TEACHERS ET CETERA WHAT THEY TOOK OVER A THREE MONTH PERIOD D LEVEL STUDENTS GAVE THE MAIZE TOLD THEM THEY WERE AS TOLD THEM THEY WERE BRIGHT AND AT THE END OF THIS THREE MONTHS PERIOD
AimeeMullins_2009P-0116565-0117492.wav THEY WERE PERFORMING AT A LEVEL AND OF COURSE THE HEARTBREAKING SIDE OF THE STUDY IS THAT THEY TOOK THE A STUDENTS
AimeeMullins_2009P-0117492-0118408.wav AND TOLD HIM THEY WERE DEEDS AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED AT THE END OF THAT THREE MONTHS PERIOD THOSE WHO WERE STILL AROUND IN SCHOOL BESIDES THE DROPPED PEOPLE HAD DROPPED OUT
AimeeMullins_2009P-0118639-0119483.wav THIS IS THE CRUCIAL PART OF THIS CASE STUDY WAS THAT THE TEACHERS WERE DUE TO
AimeeMullins_2009P-0119483-0120361.wav THE TEACHERS DIDN'T KNOW A SWITCH HAD BEEN MADE THEY WERE SIMPLY TOLD THESE ARE THE AUSTINS THESE ARE THE STUDENTS AND THAT'S HOW THEY WENT ABOUT TEACHING THEM
AimeeMullins_2009P-0120361-0120998.wav ENTREATING THEM THOUGH I THINK
AimeeMullins_2009P-0120998-0121273.wav THE ONLY TRUE DISABILITY
AimeeMullins_2009P-0121273-0122382.wav IS A CRUSHED SPIRIT A SPIRIT THAT'S BEEN CRUSHED DOESN'T HAVE HOPE IT DOESN'T SEE BEAUTY
AimeeMullins_2009P-0122382-0123096.wav IT NO LONGER HAS OUR NATURAL CHILDLIKE CURIOSITY AND OUR INNATE ABILITY TO IMAGINE
AimeeMullins_2009P-0123285-0124111.wav INSTEAD WE CAN BOLSTER A HUMAN SPIRIT TO KEEP HOPE TO SEE BEAUTY IN THEMSELVES AND OTHERS
AimeeMullins_2009P-0124111-0124794.wav TO BE CURIOUS AND IMAGINATIVE THEN WE ARE TRULY USING OUR POWER WELL
AimeeMullins_2009P-0124794-0125680.wav WHEN A SPIRIT HAS THOSE QUALITIES WE ARE ABLE TO CREATE NEW REALITIES AND NEW WAYS OF BEING
AimeeMullins_2009P-0125680-0126334.wav I'D LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH A POEM BY A FOURTEENTH CENTURY PERSIAN POET NAMED HALFUS
AimeeMullins_2009P-0126334-0127291.wav AND MY FRIEND JACQUES TOLD ME ABOUT AND A POEM IS CALLED THE GOD WHO ONLY KNOWS FOUR WORDS EVERY CHILD
AimeeMullins_2009P-0127291-0128332.wav HAS KNOWN GOD NOT THE GOD OF NAMES NOT THE GOD OF GODS BUT THE GOD WHO ONLY KNOWS FOUR WORDS
AimeeMullins_2009P-0128332-0129658.wav AND KEEPS REPEATING THEM SAYING COME DANCE WITH ME COME DANCE WITH ME YOU
BillGates_2010-0001586-0001998.wav I DO NOT TALK TO DAY ABOUT ENERGY AND CLIMATE
BillGates_2010-0001998-0003489.wav AND THAT MIGHT SEEM A BIT SURPRISING BECAUSE MY FULL TIME WORK AT THE FOUNDATION IS MOSTLY ABOUT VAXINGS AND SEEDS ABOUT THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO INVENT AND DELIVER TO HELP THE POOREST TWO BILLION LIVE BETTER LIVES
BillGates_2010-0003489-0004472.wav BUT ENERGY AND CLIMATE ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO THESE PEOPLE IN FACT MORE IMPORTANT THAN TO ANYONE ELSE ON THE PLANET
BillGates_2010-0004472-0005330.wav THE CLIMATE GETTING WORSE MEANS THAT MANY YEARS THEIR CROPS WON'T GROW THERE'LL BE TOO MUCH RAIN NOT ENOUGH RAIN
BillGates_2010-0005372-0006727.wav THINGS WILL CHANGE IN WAYS THAT THEIR FRAGILE ENVIRONMENT SIMPLY CAN'T SUPPORT AND THAT LEADS TO STARVATION LEADS TO UNCERTAINTY IT LEADS ON REST ALSO THAT THE CLIMATE CHANGES WILL BE TERRIBLE FOR THEM
BillGates_2010-0006727-0008183.wav ALSO THE PRICE OF ENERGY IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THEM IN FACT IF YOU COULD PICK JUST ONE THING TO LOWER THE PRICE OF TO REDUCE POVERTY BY FAR YOU WOULD PICK ENERGY NOW THE PRICE OF ENERGY HAS COME DOWN OVERTIME
BillGates_2010-0008183-0009134.wav I REALLY A ADVANCED CIVILIZATION I WAS BASED ON ADVANCES IN ENERGY THE COLD REVOLUTION GUILD
BillGates_2010-0009134-0010503.wav THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION AND EVEN IN THE NINETEEN HUNDREDS WE'VE SEEN A VERY RAPID DECLINE IN THE PRICE OF ELECTRICITY AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE REFRIGERATORS AIR CONDITIONING WE CAN MAKE OF MODERN MATERIALS AND DO SO MANY THINGS
BillGates_2010-0010503-0011167.wav AND SO IN A WONDERFUL SITUATION WITH ELECTRICITY IN THE RICH WORLD
BillGates_2010-0011223-0012163.wav BUT AS WE MAKE IT CHEAPER AND LET'S SAY LET'S GO FOR MAKING IT OUT TWICE AS CHEAP WE NEED TO MEET A NEW CONSTRAINT
BillGates_2010-0012163-0012879.wav AND THAT CONSTRAINT HAS TO DO WITH SEAL TOO ZEAL TOO IS WARMING THE PLANET
BillGates_2010-0012879-0013841.wav AND THE EQUATION ON SEAL TOO IS ACTUALLY A VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD ONE IF YOU SUM UP THE SEAL TOO THAT GETS EMITTED
BillGates_2010-0013841-0014663.wav THAT LEADS TO A TEMPERATURE INCREASE AND THAT TEMPERATURE INCREASE LEADS TO SOME VERY NEGATIVE EFFECTS THE EFFECT ON THE WEATHER
BillGates_2010-0014663-0015625.wav I'M PERHAPS WORSE THE INDIRECT EFFECTS IN THAT AND THE NATURAL LEGAL SYSTEMS CAN'T ADJUST TO THESE RAPID CHANGES AND SO YOU GET EGO SYSTEM COPSES
BillGates_2010-0015625-0016181.wav NOW THE EXACT AMOUNT OF HOW YOU MAP FROM A CERTAIN INCREASE IN OF SEAL TO
BillGates_2010-0016181-0017345.wav TO WHAT TEMPERATURE BEIN WHERE THE POSITIVE THEBECKS ARE THERE'S SOME UNCERTAINTY THERE BUT NOT VERY MUCH AND THERE'S CERTAINLY UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW BAD THOSE EFFECTS WILL BE BUT THEY WILL BE EXTREMELY BAD
BillGates_2010-0017345-0018588.wav I ASK THE TOP SIGN TO SEND US SEVERAL TIMES DO WE REALLY HAVE TO GET DOWN TO NEAR ZERO CAN'T WE JUST IT'LL CUT IT HALF OR QUARTER AND THE ANSWER IS THAT UNTIL WE GET NEAR TO ZERO
BillGates_2010-0018588-0020192.wav THE TEMPERATURE WILL CONTINUE TO RISE AND SO THAT'S THAT'S A BIG CHALLENGE IT'S VERY DIFFERENT THAN SAYING IN A WORD TWELVE FOOT HIGH TRUCK TRYING TO GET UNDER A TEN FOOT BRIDGE AND WE CAN JUST SORT OF SQUEEZE UNDER THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS TO GET TO ZERO
BillGates_2010-0020272-0021013.wav NOW WE PUT OUT A LOT OF CARBON DIOXIDE EVERY YEAR NOT OVER TWENTY SIX BILLION TONS AFTER EACH AMERICAN
BillGates_2010-0021013-0022431.wav IT'S ABOUT TWENTY TONS AH FOR PEOPLE IN POOR COUNTRIES IT'S LESS THAN ONE TON IT'S AN AVERAGE ABOUT FIVE TONS FOR EVERYONE ON THE PLANET AND SOMEHOW WE HAVE TO MAKE CHANGES THAT WILL BRING THAT DOWN TO ZERO
BillGates_2010-0022431-0023917.wav IT HAS BEEN CONSTANTLY GOING UP IT'S ONLY VARIOUS ECONOMIC CHANGES THAT HAVE EVEN FLATTENED IT AT ALL SO HAVE TO GO FROM RAPIDLY RISING TO FALLING AND FALLING ALL THE WAY TO ZERO THIS EQUATION HAS FOUR FACTORS
BillGates_2010-0023917-0024799.wav A LITTLE BIT OF MULTIPLICATION YOU'VE GOT IT THEN ON THE LEFT SIDE TOO YOU WANT TO GET TO ZERO AND THAT'S GOING TO BE BASED ON THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE
BillGates_2010-0024799-0025683.wav THE SERVICES EACH PERSON CHOOSING ON AVERAGE THE ENERGY ON AVERAGE FOR EACH SERVICE AND THE SEAL TOO BEING PUT OUT
BillGates_2010-0025683-0026806.wav A PERT UNIT OF ENERGY SO LET'S LOOK AT EACH ONE OF THESE AND SEE HOW WE CAN GET THIS DOWN TO ZERO I'LL PROBABLY ONE OF THESE NUMBERS IS GOING TO HAVE TO GET PRETTY NEAR TO CYRIL
BillGates_2010-0026806-0027504.wav THAT'S BACK FROM A HIGH SCHOOL OUTBREAK AND LET'S LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT FIRST WE'VE GOT POPULATION
BillGates_2010-0027504-0028543.wav NOW THE WORLD TO DAY HAS SIX POINT EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE THAT'S HEADED UP TO ABOUT NINE MILLION NOW IF WE DO A REALLY GREAT JOB ON NEW BACK SCENES HEALTH CARE
BillGates_2010-0028543-0029430.wav REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES WE COULD LOWER THAT BY PERHAPS TEN OR FIFTEEN PER CENT BUT THERE WE SEE AN INCREASE OF ABOUT ONE POINT THREE
BillGates_2010-0029430-0030042.wav THE SECOND FACTOR IS THE SERVICES WE USE THIS ENCOMPASSES EVERYTHING THE FOOD WE
BillGates_2010-0030042-0031329.wav CLOTHING T V A HEATING THESE ARE VERY GOOD THINGS A GETTING RID OF POVERTY MEANS PROVIDING THESE SERVICES TO ALMOST EVERYONE ON THE PLANET AND IT'S A GREAT THING
BillGates_2010-0031329-0032116.wav AND FOR THIS NUMBER TO GO UP IN THE RICH WORLD PERHAPS THE TOP ONE MILLION WE PROBABLY COULD CUT BACK AND USE LESS BUT EVERY YEAR
BillGates_2010-0032116-0032991.wav THIS NUMBER ON AVERAGE IS GOING TO GO UP AND SO OVER ALL THAT WILL MORE THAN DOUBLE THE SERVICES DELIVERED PER PERSON
BillGates_2010-0032991-0034092.wav CAN WE HAVE A VERY BASIC SERVICE DO YOU HAVE LIGHTING IN YOUR HOUSE TO BE ABLE TO READ YOUR HOME WORK AND IN FACT THESE KIDS DON'T SO THEY'RE GOING OUT AND READING THEIR SCHOOL WORK UNDER THE STREET LAMPS
BillGates_2010-0034238-0035302.wav NOW EFFICIENCY E THE ENERGY FOR EACH SERVICE HERE FINALLY WE HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT IS NOT GOING UP THROUGH VARIOUS INVENTIONS AND NEW WAYS OF DOING LIGHTING
BillGates_2010-0035302-0036488.wav OR THROUGH DIFFERENT TYPES OF CARS OF DIFFERENT WAYS OF BUILDING BUILDINGS THERE ARE A LOT OF SERVICES WHERE YOU CAN BRING THE ENERGY FOR THAT SERVICE DOWN QUITE SUBSTANTIALLY
BillGates_2010-0036488-0037676.wav SOME INDIVIDUAL SERVICES EVEN BRING IT DOWN BY NINETY PER CENT THERE ARE OTHER SERVICES LIKE HOW WE MAKE ELIZA HOW WE DO AIR TRANSPORT WHERE THE ROOMS FOR IMPROVEMENT ARE FAR LESS
BillGates_2010-0037676-0038654.wav AND SO OVER ALL HERE IF WE ARE OPTIMISTIC WE MAY GET A REDUCTION OF A FACTOR THREE TO EVEN PERHAPS A FACTOR OF SIX
BillGates_2010-0038654-0039968.wav BUT FOR THESE FIRST THREE FACTORS NOW WE'VE GONE FROM TWENTY SIX BILLIONS TO IT BEST I MAY BE THIRTEEN BILLION TONS AND THAT JUST WON'T CUT IT SO LET'S LOOK AT THIS FOURTH FACTOR NOW THERE'S GOING TO BE A KEY ONE
BillGates_2010-0039968-0041160.wav AND THIS IS THE AMOUNT OF SEAL TOO PUT OUT FOR EACH UNIT OF ENERGY AND SO THE QUESTION IS CAN YOU ACTUALLY GET THAT TO ZERO IF YOU BURN COAL
BillGates_2010-0041160-0042626.wav NO I'VE YOU BURNED OUT TO A GASCON ALMOST EVERY WAY WE MAKE A LIKE CHRISTIE TO DAY I EXCEPT I'M FOR THE EMERGING NOBLES AND NUCLEAR I'LL PUTS OUT SEAL TOO AND SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO WITH A GLOBAL SCALE
BillGates_2010-0042626-0043500.wav IS CREATE A NEW SYSTEM AND SO WE NEED ENERGY MIRACLES NOW WHEN IT IS THE TURMERICAL I DON'T MEAN SOMETHING THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE
BillGates_2010-0043596-0044976.wav THE MICROPOSITOR IS A MIRACLE THE PERSONAL COMPUTER'S MIRACLE OF THE INCARNATE SERVICES ARE A MIRACLE SO THE PEOPLE HERE HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THE CREATION OF MANY MIRACLES USUALLY WE DON'T HAVE A DEAD LINE
BillGates_2010-0044976-0046458.wav WE HAVE TO GET THE MIRACLE BY A CERTAIN DATE USUALLY JUST KIND OF STAND BY AND SOME COME ALONG SOME DON'T THIS IS A CASE WHERE WE OUGHT TO HAVE TO DRIVE AT FULL SPEED AND GET A MIRACLE IN A PRETTY TIGHT LINE
BillGates_2010-0046458-0047510.wav I THOUGHT HOW COULD I REALLY CAPTURE THIS IS THERE SOME KIND OF NATURAL ILLUSTRATION SOME DEMONSTRATION THAT WOULD GRAB PEOPLE'S IMAGINATION HERE
BillGates_2010-0047510-0048185.wav I THOUGHT BACK TO A YEAR AGO WHEN I BROUGHT MOSQUITOES AND SOMEHOW PEOPLE ENJOYED THAT
BillGates_2010-0048307-0049689.wav IT REALLY GOT THEM INVOLVED IN THE IDEA OF A YOU DON'T OTHER PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN MOSQUITOES SO WITH ENERGY I LIKE TO COME UP WHAT IS THIS I DECIDED THAT RELEASING FIRE FLIES
BillGates_2010-0049689-0050893.wav WOULD BE MY OWN CONTRIBUTION TO THE ENVIRONMENT HERE THIS YEAR SO HERE WE HAVE A SOME NATURAL LIFE I'M TOLD THEY DON'T BITE IN FACT THEY MIGHT EVEN NOT EVEN LEAVE THAT JAR
BillGates_2010-0051081-0052222.wav NOW THERE'S ALL SORTS OF CHEMICAL SOLUTIONS LIKE THAT ONE BUT THEY DON'T REALLY ADD UP MUCH WE NEED SOLUTIONS EITHER ONE OR SEVERAL THAT HAVE
BillGates_2010-0052222-0053287.wav UNBELIEVABLE SCALE AND UNBELIEVABLE RELIABILITY AND ALTHOUGH THOSE MANY DIRECTIONS ARE PEOPLE SEEKING I REALLY ONLY SEE FIVE THAT
BillGates_2010-0053287-0054552.wav CAN ACHIEVE THE BIG NUMBERS I'VE LEFT THAT TIDE GEO THERMAL EUGENE I FEELS THOSE MAY MAKE SOME CONTRIBUTION AND IF THEY CAN DO BETTER THAN I EXPECT SO MUCH THE BETTER BUT MY KEY POINT HERE
BillGates_2010-0054552-0055462.wav IT'S THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WORK ON EACH OF THESE LIVES AND WE CAN'T GIVE UP ANY OF THEM AH BECAUSE THEY LOOK DAUNTING BECAUSE THEY ALL
BillGates_2010-0055462-0056432.wav HAVE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES OH LET'S LOOK FIRST AT THE BURNING TOSS OF FUELS EITHER ON BURNING COAL OR BURNING NOW TO GAS WHAT YOU MEAN TO DO THERE
BillGates_2010-0056493-0057694.wav SEEMS LIKE IT MIGHT BE SIMPLE BUT IT'S NOT AND THAT'S TO TAKE ALL THE SEAL TOO AFTER YOU'VE BURNT IT GOING OUT THE FLUE PRESS RISE IT CREATE A LIQUID PUT IT SOMEWHERE AND HOPE IT STAYS THERE
BillGates_2010-0057694-0059039.wav NOW WE HAVE SOME PILOT THINGS THAT DO THIS AT THE SIXTY EIGHTY PER CENT LEVEL BUT GETTING UP TO THAT FULL PERCENTAGE THAT WILL BE VERY TRICKY AND AGRIN ON WHERE THESE SIOUX TOO WANTED YOU SHOULD BE PUT
BillGates_2010-0059039-0059716.wav WE'LL BE HARD BUT THE TOUGHEST ONE HERE IS THIS LONG TO ISSUE WHO'S CAN BE SURE WHO'S GOING TO GUARANTEE
BillGates_2010-0059716-0060724.wav OR SOMETHING THAT IS LITERALLY BILLIONS OF TIMES LARGER THAN ANY TYPE OF WASTE YOU THINK OF IN TERMS OF NUCLEAR OTHER THINGS THIS IS A LOT OF OIL
BillGates_2010-0060724-0061801.wav SO THAT'S A TOP ONE NEXT IT BE NUCLEAR IT ALSO HAS THREE BIG PROBLEMS COSTS PARTICULARLY IN HIGHLY REGULATED COUNTRIES IS HIGH
BillGates_2010-0061801-0062663.wav THE ISSUE OF THE SAFETY REALLY FEELING GOOD ABOUT NOTHING CAN GO WRONG THAT HE DID NOT HAVE THESE HUMAN OPERATORS THAT THE FUEL
BillGates_2010-0062663-0064182.wav DOESN'T GET USED FOR WEAPONS AND THEN WE'RE WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE WASTE ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT VERY LARGE THERE ARE A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT THAT PEOPLE NEED TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT SO THREE VERY DISTINCT PROBLEMS OF THAT MIGHT BE UNSOLVABLE AND SO SHOULD BE WORKED ON
BillGates_2010-0064182-0065029.wav THE LAST THREE OF THE FIVE I GROUPED TOGETHER ALL THESE ARE WHAT PEOPLE OFTEN REFER TO AS THE RENEWABLE SOURCES AND THEY ACTUALLY
BillGates_2010-0065029-0065802.wav ALTHOUGH IT'S GREAT THEY DON'T REQUIRE FUEL THEY HAVE SOME DISADVANTAGES ONE IS THAT THE DENSITY
BillGates_2010-0065802-0066489.wav AN ENERGY GATHERED IN THESE TECHNICALITIES IS DRAMATICALLY LESS THAN A POWER PLANT THIS IS ENERGY FARMING
BillGates_2010-0066489-0067666.wav SO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MANY SQUARE MILES THOUSANDS OF TIMES MORE AREA THAN THEN YOU THINK OF ITS NORMAL ENERGY PLANT ALSO THESE ARE INTERMITTENT SOURCES THE SUN DOESN'T SHINE
BillGates_2010-0067666-0068350.wav ALL DAY DOESN'T SHINE EVERY DAY AND LIKEWISE THE WIND DOESN'T BLOW ALL THE TIME AND SO YOU DEPEND ON THESE SOURCES
BillGates_2010-0068350-0069211.wav YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME WAY OF GETTING ENERGY DURING THOSE TIME PERIODS THAT IT'S NOT AVAILABLE SO WE'VE GOT BIG COST CHALLENGES HERE
BillGates_2010-0069211-0070665.wav WE HAVE TRANSMISSION CHALLENGES FOR EXAMPLE SAY THIS ENERGY SOURCE IS OUTSIDE YOUR COUNTRY I NOT ONLY NEED THE TECHNOLOGY BUT YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE RISK OF THE ENERGY COMING FROM ELSEWHERE AND FINALLY THIS STORAGE PROBLEM
BillGates_2010-0070665-0071808.wav AND TO REALIZE THIS I WENT THROUGH AND LOOKED AT ALL THE TYPES OF BATTERIES THAT GET MADE FOR CARS FOR COMPUTERS FOR FUNDS FOR FLASHLIGHTS FOR EVERYTHING AND COMPARED THAT
BillGates_2010-0071808-0072717.wav TO THE AMOUNT OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY THE WORLD USES AND WHEN I FOUND IS THAT ALL THE BATTERIES WE MAKE NOW COULD STORE LESS THAN TEN MINUTES
BillGates_2010-0072717-0073409.wav OF ALL THE ENERGY AND SO IN FACT WE NEED A BIG BREAK THROUGH HERE SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE
BillGates_2010-0073409-0074885.wav A FACTOR OF A HUNDRED BETTER THAN THE APPROACHES WE HAVE NOW IT'S NOT IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE BUT IT'S NOT A VERY EASY THING NOW THIS SHOWS UP WHEN YOU TRY TO GET THE INTERMITTENT SOURCE TO BE ABOVE SAY TWENTY TO THIRTY PER CENT
BillGates_2010-0074885-0075717.wav OF WHAT YOU'RE USING IF YOU WERE COUNTING ON IT FOR A HUNDRED PER CENT YOU NEED A AN INCREDIBLE MIRACLE BATTERY
BillGates_2010-0075717-0076673.wav NOW HOW WE'RE GOING TO GO FOR IT ON THIS WHAT'S WHAT'S THE RIGHT APPROACH IS IT A MAN HAT AND PROJECT WHAT'S THE THING THAT CAN GET US THERE WELL WE NEED LOTS
BillGates_2010-0076673-0077744.wav OF COMPANIES OF WORKING ON THIS HUNDREDS IN EACH OF THESE FIVE PATHS WE NEED AT LEAST A HUNDRED PEOPLE AND LOT OF EM YOU LOOK AND SAY THEY'RE CRAZY THAT'S GOOD
BillGates_2010-0077744-0078466.wav AND I THINK YOU'RE IN THE TED GROUP WE HAVE MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY PURSUING THIS A
BillGates_2010-0078466-0080389.wav BILL GROSS HAS SEVERAL COMPANIES INCLUDING ONE CALLED E SOLAR THAT HAS SOME GREAT SOLAR THERMAL TECHNOLOGY AVENNODE COLOSSALS INVESTING IN DOZENS OF COMPANIES AH THAT ARE DOING GREAT THINGS AND HAVE ON INTERESTING POSSIBILITIES AND I'M I'M TRYING TO HELP BACK THAT I NEEDN'T MARVEL THEN I AX YOUR BACKING IN A COMPANY
BillGates_2010-0080389-0081193.wav THAT PERHAPS SURPRISINGLY IS ACTUALLY TAKING THE NUCLEAR APPROACH THERE ARE SOME INNOVATIONS IN NUCLEAR MODULAR LIQUID
BillGates_2010-0081193-0082339.wav AH AN INNOVATION REALLY STOPPED IN THIS INDUSTRY QUITE SOME TIME AGO TO THE IDEA THAT THERE'S SOME GOOD IDEAS LYING AROUND AH IS NOT ALL THAT SURPRISING THE IDEA OF A TERROR POWER
BillGates_2010-0082339-0083304.wav IS THAT INSTEAD OF BURNING THE PART OF URANIUM THE ONE PER CENT WHICH IS THE TWO THIRTY FIVE WE DECIDED WILL LET'S BURN THE NINETY NINE PER CENT
BillGates_2010-0083304-0084018.wav U TWO THIRTY EIGHT IT IS KIND OF A CRAZY IDEA AND FACT PEOPLE HAVE TALKED ABOUT IT FOR A LONG TIME
BillGates_2010-0084018-0085031.wav BUT THEY COULD NEVER SIMULATE PROPERLY WHETHER IT WOULD WORK OR NOT AND SO THROUGH THE ADVENT OF MODERN SUPER COMPUTERS THAT NOW YOU CAN SIMULATE AND SEE THAT YES WITH THE RIGHT
BillGates_2010-0085031-0085894.wav MATERIALS APPROACH AH THIS LOOKS LIKE IT WOULD WORK AND BECAUSE YOU'RE BURNING THAT NINETY NINE PER CENT YOU HAVE
BillGates_2010-0085894-0087360.wav A GREATLY IMPROVED COST OF PROFILE YOU ACTUALLY BURN UP THE WASTE AND YOU CANNOT USE AS FUEL ALL THE LEFT OVER WASTE FROM TO DAY'S REACTORS AND SO INSTEAD OF WORRYING ABOUT THEM YOU JUST TAKE THAT IT'S A GREAT THING
BillGates_2010-0087360-0088384.wav IT BREEDS THIS URANIUM AS IT GOES ALONG IT'S CUT OUT LIKE THE CANDLEING SEEDS IT'S A LOG THERE OFTEN REFERRED TO AS A TRAVELLING WAVE REACTOR IN TERMS OF FUEL
BillGates_2010-0088384-0089691.wav AH THIS REALLY SOLVES THE PROBLEM I'VE GOT A PICTURE HERE OF A PLACE IN KENTUCKY THIS IS THE LEFT OVER THE NINETY NINE PER CENT WHERE THEY'VE TAKEN OUT THE PART THEY WERE NOW SO CALLED DEPLETED GERANIUM THAT WOULD POWER THE U S
BillGates_2010-0089691-0090681.wav FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS AND SIMPLY BY FILTERING SEA WATER IN AN INEXPENSIVE PROCESS YOU HAVE ENOUGH FUEL FOR THE ENTIRE LIFETIME OF THE REST OF THE PLANET
BillGates_2010-0090681-0091781.wav YOU KNOW IT'S GOT LOTS OF CHALLENGES AHEAD BUT IT IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE MANY HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF IDEAS THAT WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD
BillGates_2010-0091781-0093270.wav SO LET'S THINK HOW SHOULD WE MEASURE OURSELVES WHAT SHOULD OUR REPORT CARD I LOOK LIKE WELL LET'S GO OUT TO WHERE WE REALLY NEED TO GET IN AND THEN I'LL LOOK AT THE INTERMEDIATE FOR TWENTY FIFTY YOU'VE HEARD MANY PEOPLE TALK ABOUT
BillGates_2010-0093270-0094056.wav THIS EIGHTY PER CENT REDUCTION THAT REALLY IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE GET THERE AND THAT TWENTY PER CENT WILL BE USED UP
BillGates_2010-0094056-0095342.wav THINGS GOING ON IN POOR COUNTRIES STILL SOME AGRICULTURE I HOPEFULLY WE WILL HAVE CLEANED UP A FORESTRY CEMENT SO TO GET TO THAT EIGHTY PER CENT THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES
BillGates_2010-0095342-0096309.wav INCLUDING COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA WILL HAVE HAD TO SWITCH THEIR ELECTRONIC ELECTRICITY GENERATION ALL TOGETHER SO THE OTHER GREATEST ARE WE DEPLORING
BillGates_2010-0096309-0097289.wav THIS ZEROMMISSION TECHNOLOGY HAVE WE DEPLOITED IN ALL THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES AND WE'RE IN THE PROCESSES OF GETTING IT OUT ELSEWHERE THAT SUPER IMPORTANT
BillGates_2010-0097289-0098146.wav THAT'S THE KEY ELEMENT OF MAKING THAT REPORT CARD SO BACKING UP FROM THERE WHAT SHOULD THE TWENTY TWENTY REPORT CARD LOOKED LIKE
BillGates_2010-0098146-0099642.wav WELL IT AGAIN IT SHOULD HAVE THE TWO ELEMENTS AND WE SHOULD GO THROUGH THESE EFFICIENCY MEASURES TO START GETTING REDUCTIONS THE LESS WE ADMIT THE LESS THAT SUM WILL BE OF THE TWO AND THEREFORE THE LESS THE TEMPERATURE BUT IN SOME WAYS THE GRADE WE GET THERE
BillGates_2010-0099642-0100725.wav DOING THINGS THAT DON'T GET US ALL THE WAY TO THE BIG REDUCTIONS IS ONLY EQUALLY OR EVEN SLIGHTLY LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE OTHER WHICH IS THE PIECE OF INNOVATION
BillGates_2010-0100725-0101719.wav ON THESE BREAKTHROUGHS THESE BREAKTHROUGHS WE NEED TO MOVE THOSE AT FULL SPEED AND WE CAN MEASURE THAT IN TERMS OF COMPANIES PILOT PROJECTS REGULATORY THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN CHANGED
BillGates_2010-0101719-0103401.wav THERE'S A LOT OF GREAT BOOKS THE MEN WRITTEN ABOUT THIS THE AL GORE BOOK ARE CHOICE AND THE DAVID MACKAY BOOK THE STAINABLE ENERGY WITHOUT THE HOT AIR THEY REALLY GO THROUGH IT AND I THINK CAN GET OUT OF FRAMEWORK THAT THIS CAN BE DISCUSSED BROADLY BECAUSE WE NEED BROAD BACKING FOR THIS
BillGates_2010-0103401-0104035.wav THERE IS A LOT THAT HAS TO COME TOGETHER SO THIS IS A WISH IT'S A VERY CONCRETE WISH THAT
BillGates_2010-0104035-0104905.wav WE INVENT THIS TECHNOLOGY IF YOU GAVE ME ONLY ONE WISH FOR THE NEXT FIFTY YEARS I CAN PICK WHOSE PRESIDENT I CAN PICK A VACATION
BillGates_2010-0104905-0105571.wav WHICH IS SOMETHING I LOVE OR I COULD PICK THAT THIS THING THAT'S HALF THE COST WITH YOU TWO GETS INVENTED
BillGates_2010-0105571-0106601.wav THIS IS THE WISH I WOULD PICK THIS IS THE ONE OF THE GREATEST IMPACT IF WE DON'T GET THIS WISH THE DIVISION BETWEEN THE PEOPLE WHO THINK SHORT TERM A LONG TERM WILL BE TERRIBLE
BillGates_2010-0106601-0107999.wav BETWEEN YOU US AND CHINA BETWEEN POOR COUNTRIES AND RICH AND MOST OF ALL THE LIVES OF THOSE TWO BILLION WILL BE FAR WORSE SO WHAT DO WE HAVE TO DO WHAT AM I APPEALING TO YOU TO I STEPPED FORWARD AND
BillGates_2010-0107999-0108733.wav AND DRIVE WE NEED TO GO FOR MORE RESEARCH FUNDING AND WHEN COUNTRIES GET TOGETHER AT PLACES LIKE COPENHAGEN
BillGates_2010-0108733-0109597.wav JUST DISCUSS THE FIELD TOO THEY SHOULD DISCUSS THIS INNOVATION AGENDA AND YOU'D BE STUNNED AT THE RIDICULOUSLY LOW LEVELS OF SPENDING
BillGates_2010-0109597-0110464.wav ON THESE INNOVATED APPROACHES WE DON'T NEED THE MARKING INSENNIS SEALED TO TACKS CAP AND TRADES SOMETHING THAT GETS THAT PRICE SIGNAL OUT THERE
BillGates_2010-0110464-0111838.wav WE NEED TO GET THE MESSAGE OUT WE NEED HAVE THIS DIALOGUE BE A MORE RASH AND MORE UNDERSTANDABLE DIALOGUE ON INCLUDING THE STEPS THAT THE GOVERNMENT TAKES THIS IS AN IMPORTANT WISH BUT IT IS ONE I THINK WE CAN ACHIEVE THANK YOU
BillGates_2010-0113236-0113383.wav THANK YOU THANK YOU
BillGates_2010-0113940-0114550.wav THANK YOU I AM SET TO AND TO SAY MORE ABOUT ABOUT A TERRA POWER RIGHT OF
BillGates_2010-0114550-0115006.wav WHAT CAN YOU GIVE A SENSE WHAT SORT OF SCALE OF INVESTMENT THIS IS
BillGates_2010-0115006-0116124.wav BUT TO THE ACTION DO THIS SOFT WHEREBY THE SUPER COMPUTER HIRE ALL THE GREAT SCIENTISTS WHICH WE'VE DONE THAT'S ONLY TENS OF MILLIONS AND EVEN ONCE WE TEST OUR MATERIALS OUT
BillGates_2010-0116124-0117033.wav AH IN A RUSSIAN REACTOR TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR MATERIALS WORK PROPERLY THEN YOU'LL ONLY BE UP IN HUNDREDS MILLIONS THE TOUGHING IS BUILDING THE PILOT REACTOR
BillGates_2010-0117033-0117995.wav AH FINDING THE SEVERAL BILLION I'LL FIND THE REGULATOR THE LOCATION THAT WILL ACTUALLY BUILD THE FIRST ONE OF THESE WHEN YOU GET THE FIRST ONE BUILT
BillGates_2010-0117995-0118832.wav IF IT WORKS AS ADVERTISED THEN IT'S AS CLEAR AS DAY BECAUSE THE ECONOMICS THE ENERGY DENSITY ARE SO DIFFERENT THE NUCLEUS WE KNOW
BillGates_2010-0118832-0120110.wav AND SO TO UNDERSTAND IT RIGHT THIS INVOLVES BUILDING DEEP INTO THE GROUND ON ONE SIDE LIKE A VERTICAL AND A COLUMN OF NUCLEAR FUEL OF THIS SORT OF SPENT URANIUM AND THEN A MINUTE AND THEN THE PRESSURE STARTS AT THE TOP AND KIND OF WORK DOWN
BillGates_2010-0120110-0121078.wav THAT'S RIGHT TO DAY YOU ARE ALWAYS REFUSING THE REACTORCY OF LOTS OF PEOPLE AND LOTS OF CONTROLS THAT CAN GO WRONG THAT THING WE ARE OPENING IT UP AND MOVING THINGS IN AND OUT THAT'S
BillGates_2010-0121078-0121893.wav THAT'S NOT GOOD SO IF YOU CAN'T VERY VERY CHEAP FUEL THEN YOU CAN PUT SIXTY YEARS IN JUST THINK OF IT AS A LOG
BillGates_2010-0121893-0122743.wav PUT IT DOWN AND NOT HAVE THOSE SAME COMPLEXITIES AND IT JUST SITS THERE AND BURNS FOR SIX YEARS AH AND THEN IT'S DONE
BillGates_2010-0122743-0123156.wav IT'S THAT IT'S A NUCLEAR POWER PLANT THAT IS ITS OWN WASTE DISPOSAL SOLUTION
BillGates_2010-0123156-0124289.wav YOU WILL WIN HAMMONDS WITH THE WASTE YOU CAN YOU CAN LET IT SIT THERE AH THERE'S A LOT LESS WASTE UNDER THIS APPROACH AH THEN YOU CAN TAKE THAT AND PUT IT INTO ANOTHER ONE AND BURN THAT
BillGates_2010-0124289-0125283.wav AND WHEN WE START OUT ACTUALLY BY TAKING THE WASTE THAT EXISTS TO DAY THAT SITTING IN THESE COOLING POOLS ARE DRY CASTING BY REACTERS THAT'S OUR FUEL
BillGates_2010-0125283-0126334.wav TO BEGIN WITH SO THE THING THAT'S BEEN A PROBLEM FROM THOSE REACTORS IS ACTUALLY WHAT GETS FED INTO OURS AND YOU'RE REDUCING THE VOLUME OF THE RACE QUITE DRAMATICALLY AS YOU GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS
BillGates_2010-0126334-0127077.wav HAVEN'T YOU TALKING TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD ABOUT THE POSSIBILITIES HERE WHERE WHERE IS THERE MOST INTEREST IN ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING WITH THIS
BillGates_2010-0127077-0127994.wav WELL WE HAVEN'T I'VE PICKED A PARTICULAR PLACE BUT AH AND THERE'S ALL THESE AN INTERESTING DISCLOSURE RULES HAVE BY ANYTHING THAT'S CALLED NUCLEAR
BillGates_2010-0128098-0129028.wav SO IT WE'VE GOT A LOT OF INTEREST AH THE PEOPLE FROM THE COMPANY HAVE BEEN IN RUSSIA AND INDIA CHINA I'VE BEEN BACK SEEING THE SECRETARY OF ENERGY HERE TALKING ABOUT HOW THIS
BillGates_2010-0129028-0130155.wav I FITS INTO THE ENERGY AGENDA SOME OPTIMISTIC AH YOU KNOW THE FRENCH AND JAPANESE HAVE DONE SOME WORK THIS IS A VARIANT ON SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN DONE IT IS AN IMPORTANT
BillGates_2010-0130155-0131091.wav ADVANCED BUT IT'S LIKE A FAST RAFTER IN A LOT OF COMPOUND COUNTRIES TO BUILD THEM SO ANYBODY WAS NOT A RAFTER IS A CANDIDATE TO TO BE WHERE THE FIRST ONE GETS BUILT
BillGates_2010-0131091-0131937.wav SO IN IN YOUR MIND I AM TIME SCALE AND LIKELIHOOD OF ACTUALLY TAKING SOMETHING LIKE THIS LIFE
BillGates_2010-0131937-0132214.wav WHAT WE NEED FOR ONE OF THESE
BillGates_2010-0132214-0133186.wav HIGH SCALE ELECTRIC ELECTRO GENERATION THINGS THAT'S VERY CHEAP WE HAVE TWENTY YEARS TO INVENT AND THEN TWENTY YEARS TO DEPLOY THAT SORT OF DEAD LINE
BillGates_2010-0133186-0134086.wav THAT THE ENVIRONMENT MODELS ENVIRONMENT MODELSIVE HAVE SHOWN US THAT WE HAVE TO MEET AND IN A TERROR POWER IF THINGS GO WELL
BillGates_2010-0134086-0134899.wav ALL WHICH IS WISHING FOR LOT COULD EASILY MEET THAT AND THERE ARE FORTUNATELY NOW DOZENS OF COMPANIES WE NEED TO BE HUNDREDS
BillGates_2010-0134899-0136283.wav WHO LIKEWISE IF THEIR SCIENCE GOES WELL IF THE FUNDING FOR THEIR PLANT PILOT PLANTS GOES WELL THAT THEY THEY CAN KEEP FOR THIS AND IT'S BEST THAT MULTIPLE SUCCEED BECAUSE THEY NEED TO USE A MIX A MIX OF THESE THINGS WE CERTAINLY NEED ONE TO SUCCEED
BillGates_2010-0136283-0136854.wav IN TIMES OF BIG SCALE POSSIBLE GAME CHANGES IT IS THE BIGGEST THAT YOU'RE AWARE ABOUT THERE
BillGates_2010-0136854-0137835.wav AN ENERGY BREAK THROUGH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN WITHOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINT BUT THE ENVIRONMENT MAKES THAT SO MUCH
BillGates_2010-0137924-0138694.wav SO MUCH GREATER IN THE NUCLEAR SPACE THERE ARE OTHER INNOVATORS AND WE DON'T KNOW THEIR WORK AS WELL AS WE KNOW THIS ONE
BillGates_2010-0138694-0139478.wav THE MODULE PEOPLE OH THAT'S A DIFFERENT APPROACH THERE'S A LIQUID TYPEWRITER WHICH SEEMS LITTLE HARD BUT MAYBE THEY SAY ABOUT US
BillGates_2010-0139591-0140511.wav AND SO THERE ARE DIFFERENT ONES BUT THE BEAUTY THIS IS A MOLECULE OF URANIUM HAS A MILLION TIMES AS MUCH ENERGY AS A MOLECULE OF SAY COAL
BillGates_2010-0140590-0141946.wav AND SO IF YOU CAN DEAL WITH THE NEGATIVES WHICH ARE ESSENTIALLY THE RADIATION THE FOOTPRINT AND COST THE POTENTIAL AND TERMS OF EFFECT ON LAND AND VARIOUS THINGS IS IN ALMOST IN A CLASS OF ITS OWN
BillGates_2010-0142125-0142221.wav IF THIS DOESN'T WORK
BillGates_2010-0142431-0143126.wav THEN WHAT DO WE HAVE TO START TAKING EMERGENCY MEASURES TO KEEP THE TEMPERATURE OF THE EARTH STABLE
BillGates_2010-0143126-0143382.wav YOU GET INTO THAT SITUATION IT'S LIKE
BillGates_2010-0143382-0143552.wav A FEW

DanBarber_2010-0079349-0079613.wav TO SHAKE UP IMPURITIES AND THEN HE ADDED
DanBarber_2010-0079673-0079983.wav BUT OUR WATER HAS NO IMPURITIES
DanBarber_2010-0080207-0080499.wav A FARM A DOZEN FEET ITS FISH
DanBarber_2010-0080634-0080923.wav A FARM THE MEASURE OF SUCCESS
DanBarber_2010-0080923-0081110.wav BY THE SUCCESS OF ITS CREDITORS
DanBarber_2010-0081181-0081391.wav AND THEN I REALISE WHAT HE SAYS
DanBarber_2010-0081391-0082273.wav A FARM THAT HAS NO IMPURITIES HE MADE A BIG STATEMENT BECAUSE THE WATER THAT FLOWS THROUGH THAT FARM COMES IN FROM THE GROTTO OF YOUR RIVER
DanBarber_2010-0082334-0082802.wav THE RIVER THE CARRIES WITH IT ALL THE THINGS THE RIVERS TEND TO CARRY THESE DAYS
DanBarber_2010-0082865-0083146.wav CHEMICAL CONTAMINANCE TEST ASIDE RUN OFF
DanBarber_2010-0083197-0083423.wav AND WHEN IT WORKS ITS WAY THROUGH THE SYSTEM
DanBarber_2010-0083562-0083908.wav AND LEAVES THE WATER IS CLEANER THAN WHEN IT ENTERED
DanBarber_2010-0083980-0084238.wav THE SYSTEM IS SO HEALTHY IT PURIFIES THE WATER
DanBarber_2010-0084369-0084757.wav SO NOT JUST A FARM A DOZEN FEET IT WAS NOT JUST A FARM TO MEASURES THE HEALTH
DanBarber_2010-0084820-0085015.wav ITS SUCCESS BY THE HEALTH OF ITS CREDITORS
DanBarber_2010-0085085-0085415.wav BUT A FARM IS LITERALLY A WATER PURIFICATION PLANT

DanBarber_2010-0085982-0086400.wav BUT FOR YOU AND ME AS WELL BECAUSE WHEN THAT WATER LEAVES IT DUMPS OUT INTO THE ATLANTIC
DanBarber_2010-0086695-0087071.wav DROP IN THE OCEAN I KNOW BUT I'LL TAKE IT AND SO SHOULD YOU

DanielKahneman_2010-0001580-0001832.wav EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT HAPPINESS
DanielKahneman_2010-0001946-0002528.wav I HAD SOMEBODY COUNT THE NUMBER OF BOOKS WITH HAPPINESS IN THE TITLE PUBLISHED IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS
DanielKahneman_2010-0002528-0002975.wav AND THEY GAVE UP AFTER ABOUT FORTY AND MORE
DanielKahneman_2010-0002975-0003857.wav THERE IS A HUGE WAVE OF INTEREST IN HAPPINESS AMONG RESEARCHES THERE IS A LOT OF HAPPINESS COACHING EVERYBODY WOULD LIKE TO MAKE PEOPLE HAPPIER
DanielKahneman_2010-0004006-0004852.wav BUT IN SPITE OF ALL THIS FLOOD OF WORK THERE ARE SEVERAL KINDS OF TRAPS THAT OUGHT TO MAKE IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO THINK STRAIGHT ABOUT HAPPINESS
DanielKahneman_2010-0004852-0006211.wav AND MY TALK TO DAY WILL BE MOSTLY ABOUT THESE KIND OF TRAPS THIS APPLIES TO LAY PEOPLE THINKING OF THEIR OWN HAPPINESS AND IT APPLIES TO SCHOLARS THINKING ABOUT HAPPINESS BECAUSE IT TURNS OUTWARD JUST AS BEST UP AS ANYBODY ELSE'S
DanielKahneman_2010-0006342-0007634.wav THE FIRST OF THESE IS A RELUCTANCE TO ADMIT COMPLEXITY TURNS OUT THAT THE WORD HAPPINESS IS JUST NOT A USEFUL WORD ANY MORE BECAUSE WE APPLY TO TOO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS
DanielKahneman_2010-0007634-0008899.wav I THINK THERE IS ONE PARTICULAR MEANING TO WHICH WE MIGHT RESTRICT IT BUT BY AND LARGE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WILL HAVE TO GIVE UP AND WILL HAVE TO ADOPT A MORE COMPLICATED VIEW OF WHAT WELL BEING IS
DanielKahneman_2010-0008899-0010499.wav THE SECOND TRAP IS A CONFUSION BETWEEN EXPERIENCE AND MEMORY BASICALLY BETWEEN BEING HAPPY IN YOUR LIFE AND BEING HAPPY ABOUT YOUR LIFE OR HAPPY WITH YOUR LIFE AND THOSE ARE TWO VERY DIFFERENT CONCEPTS AND THEY ARE BOTH LUMPS IN THE NOTION OF HAPPINESS
DanielKahneman_2010-0010499-0011979.wav AND THE THIRD IS IT'S THE FOCUSING ILLUSION AND IT'S THE UNFORTUNATE FACT THAT WE CAN'T THINK ABOUT ANY CIRCUMSTANCE THAT EFFECTS WILL BE WITHOUT DISTORTING ITS IMPORTANCE AND THIS IS A REAL COGNITIVE TRAP THERE IS JUST NO WAY OF GETTING IT RIGHT
DanielKahneman_2010-0012127-0012679.wav NOW I'D LIKE TO START WITH AN EXAMPLE OF SOMEBODY
DanielKahneman_2010-0012679-0013063.wav WERE THE QUESTION AND ANSWER CERTAIN AFTER ONE OF MY LECTURES
DanielKahneman_2010-0013063-0013647.wav REPORTED A STORY AND THAT WITH A STORY HE SAID HE HAD BEEN LISTENING TO A SYMPHONY
DanielKahneman_2010-0013647-0014677.wav AND IT WAS ABSOLUTELY GLORIOUS MUSIC AND AT THE VERY END OF THE RECORDING THERE WAS A DREADFUL SCREECHING SOUND AND THEN HE ADDED READING QUITE EMOTIONALLY
DanielKahneman_2010-0014677-0014982.wav IT RUINED THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE
DanielKahneman_2010-0014982-0015251.wav BUT IT HAD NOT
DanielKahneman_2010-0015251-0016819.wav IT HAD RUINED WITH THE MEMORY OF THE EXPERIENCE HE HAD HAD THE EXPERIENCE HE HAD HAD TWENTY MINUTES OF GLORIOUS MUSIC THEY COUNTED FOR NOTHING BECAUSE HE WAS LEFT WITH A MEMORY THE MEMORY WAS RUINED AND THE MEMORY WAS ALL THAT HE HAD GOTTEN TO KEEP
DanielKahneman_2010-0016819-0017863.wav BUT THIS IS TELLING US THAT WE MIGHT BE THINKING OF OURSELVES AND OF OTHER PEOPLE IN TERMS OF TWO SELVES AH THERE IS AN EXPERIENCING SELF
DanielKahneman_2010-0017863-0018198.wav WHO LIVES IN THE PRESENT
DanielKahneman_2010-0018198-0019632.wav AND KNOWS THE PRESENT CAPABLE OF REVIVING THE PAST BUT BASICALLY IT HAS ONLY THE PRESENT IT'S THE EXPERIENCING SELF THAT THE DOCTOR APPROACHES YOU KNOW WHEN THE DOCTOR ASKED DOES IT HURT NOW WHEN I TOUCH YOU HERE
DanielKahneman_2010-0019632-0019893.wav AND THEN THERE IS A REMEMBERING
DanielKahneman_2010-0019893-0020282.wav AND REMEMBERING SELF IS THE ONE THAT KEEPS SCORE
DanielKahneman_2010-0020282-0020793.wav AND MAINTAIN THE STORY OF OUR LIFE AND IT'S THE ONE THAT THE DOCTOR
DanielKahneman_2010-0020793-0021056.wav IN ASKING THE QUESTION
DanielKahneman_2010-0021249-0022118.wav HOW HAVE YOU BEEN FEELING LATELY OR HOW IS YOUR TRIP TO URANIA SOMETHING LIKE THAT THOSE ARE TWO VERY DIFFERENT ENTITIES THE EXPERIENCING SELF
DanielKahneman_2010-0022118-0022829.wav AND THE END THE REMEMBERING SELF AND GETTING CONFUSED BETWEEN THEM IS PART OF A MESS ABOUT THE NOTION OF HAPPINESS
DanielKahneman_2010-0022960-0023341.wav NOW THE REMEMBERING SELF
DanielKahneman_2010-0023341-0023780.wav IS A STORY TELLER AND THAT REALLY STARTS WITH A BASE
DanielKahneman_2010-0023780-0025112.wav RESPONSE OF OUR MEMORY STARTS IMMEDIATELY WE DON'T ONLY TELL STORIES WHEN WE SET OUT TO TELL STORIES OUR MEMORY TELLS OUR STORIES THAT IS WHAT WE GET TO KEEP FROM OUR EXPERIENCES IS A STORY
DanielKahneman_2010-0025112-0025498.wav AND LET ME BEGIN WITH ONE EXAMPLE
DanielKahneman_2010-0025498-0026823.wav THIS IS AN OLD STUDY THOSE ARE ACTUAL PATIENTS UNDERGOING A PAINFUL PROCEDURE I WON'T GO INTO DETAIL IT'S NO LONGER PAINFUL THESE DAYS BUT IT WAS PAINFUL WHEN THE SIXTH WHEN THE STUDY WAS RUN IN THE NINETEEN NINETY
DanielKahneman_2010-0026823-0027700.wav THERE ARE TO REPORT ON THEIR PAIN EVERY SIXTY SECONDS AND HERE ARE TWO PATIENTS THOSE ARE THEIR RECORDS AND WHO ARE ASKED
DanielKahneman_2010-0027700-0028636.wav WHO OF THEM SUFFERED MORE AND IT'S A VERY EASY QUESTION WHEN CLEARLY PATIENT BE SUFFERED MORE HIS COLONNOSCOPE WAS LONGER AND EVERY
DanielKahneman_2010-0028636-0029316.wav MINUTE OF PAIN THAT PATIENT A HAD PATIENT B HAD AND MORE BUT NOW THERE IS ANOTHER QUESTION
DanielKahneman_2010-0029316-0029631.wav HOW MUCH DID THESE PATIENT THINK THEY SUFFERED
DanielKahneman_2010-0029698-0029858.wav AND HERE IS A SURPRISE
DanielKahneman_2010-0029858-0030915.wav AND THE SURPRISES THAT PATIENT A HAD A MUCH WORSE MEMORY OF THE COLONOSCOPE THAN PATIENT B THE STORIES OF THE COLONOSCOPES WERE DIFFERENT
DanielKahneman_2010-0030915-0031511.wav AND BECAUSE A VERY CRITICAL PART OF THE STORIES HOW IT ENDS
DanielKahneman_2010-0031511-0033046.wav AND NEITHER OF THESE STORIES IS VERY INSPIRING OR GREAT BUT ONE OF THEM IS THIS THING BUT ONE OF THEM IS DISTINCTLY WORSE THAN THE OTHER AND THE ONE THAT IS WORSE IS THE ONE WHERE PAIN WAS NOT TO SPEAK AT THE VERY END
DanielKahneman_2010-0033046-0034448.wav IT'S A BAD STORY HOW DO WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE WE ASK THESE PEOPLE AFTER THEIR COLONELSCOPE AND MUCH LATER TOO HOW BAD WAS THE WHOLE THING IN TOTAL AND IT WAS MUCH WORSE FOR A THAN FOR B IN MEMORY
DanielKahneman_2010-0034448-0035446.wav NOW THIS IS A DIRECT CONFLICT BETWEEN THE EXPERIENCING SELF AND THE REMEMBERING SELF FROM THE POINT OF VIEW THE EXPERIENCING SELF CLEARLY BE HAD A WORSE TIME
DanielKahneman_2010-0035446-0037132.wav NOW WHAT YOU COULD DO WITH PATIENT A AND WE ACTUALLY RAN CLINICAL EXPERIMENTS AND IT HAS BEEN DONE AND IT DOES WORK YOU COULD ACTUALLY EXTEND THE COLONNOSCOPY OF PATIENT A BY JUST KEEPING THE TUBE IN WITHOUT DRINKING IT TOO MUCH THAT WILL
DanielKahneman_2010-0037132-0038478.wav THAT WILL CAUSE THE PATIENT TO SUFFER BUT JUST A LITTLE AND MUCH LESS THAN BEFORE AND IF YOU DO THAT FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES YOU HAVE MADE THE EXPERIENCING SELF OF PATIENT A WORSE OFF
DanielKahneman_2010-0038478-0039174.wav AND YOU HAVE MADE THE REMEMBERING SORT OF PATIENT A LOT BETTER OFF BECAUSE NOW YOU HAVE ENDOWED PATIENT A
DanielKahneman_2010-0039174-0039589.wav WITH A BETTER STORY ABOUT HIS EXPERIENCE
DanielKahneman_2010-0039685-0039958.wav WHAT FINDS A STORY
DanielKahneman_2010-0039958-0041769.wav AND THAT IS TRUE OF THE STORIES THAT MEMORY DELIVERS FOR US AND IT'S ALSO TRUE OF THE STORIES THAT WE MAKE UP AND WHAT DEFINES A STORY ARE CHANGES SIGNIFICANT MOMENTS AND ENDINGS ENDINGS ARE VERY VERY IMPORTANT AND IN THIS CASE THE ENDING DOMINATED
DanielKahneman_2010-0041914-0042339.wav NOW THE EXPERIENCING SELF LIVES ITS LIFE
DanielKahneman_2010-0042339-0043310.wav CONTINUOUSLY HAS MOMENTS OF EXPERIENCE ONE AFTER THE OTHER AND YOU CAN ASK WHAT HAPPENS TO THESE MOMENTS AND THE ANSWER IS REALLY STRAIGHTFORWARD
DanielKahneman_2010-0043310-0044806.wav THEY ARE LOST FOREVER MEAN MOST OF THE MOMENTS OF OUR LIFE AND ARE CALCULATED YOU KNOW THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PRESENT IS SAID TO BE ABOUT THREE SECONDS LONG THAT MEANS THAT YOU KNOW AND IN A LIFE THERE ARE ABOUT SIX HUNDRED MILLION OF THEM IN A MONTH THERE ABOUT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND
DanielKahneman_2010-0044917-0045610.wav MOST OF THEM DON'T LEAVE A TRACE MOST OF THEM COMPLETELY IGNORED BY THE REMEMBERING SELF
DanielKahneman_2010-0045610-0046008.wav AND YET SOMEHOW YOU GET THE SENSE THAT THEY SHOULD COUNT
DanielKahneman_2010-0046008-0046496.wav THAT WHAT HAPPENS DURING THESE MOMENTS OF EXPERIENCE IS OUR LIFE
DanielKahneman_2010-0046496-0046973.wav IT IS THE FINITE RESOURCE THAT WE ARE SPENDING WHILE WE ARE ON THIS EARTH
DanielKahneman_2010-0046973-0047905.wav AND HOW TO SPEND IT WOULD SEEM TO BE IRRELEVANT BUT THAT IS NOT THE STORY THAT OUR REMEMBERING SELF KEEPS FOR US SO WE HAVE
DanielKahneman_2010-0047905-0048733.wav REMEMBERING SELF AND EXPERIENCING SELF AND THEY ARE REALLY QUITE DISTINCT THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM IS IN THE HANDLING OF TIME
DanielKahneman_2010-0048859-0049741.wav FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE EXPERIENCING SELF IF YOU HAVE A VACATION AND THE SECOND WEEK IS JUST AS GOOD AS THE FIRST
DanielKahneman_2010-0049741-0050858.wav THE TWO WEEKS VACATION IS TWICE AS GOOD AS THE ONE WEEK VACATION THAT SNUB THE WAY IT WORKS AT ALL FOR THE REMEMBERING SELF FOR THE REMEMBERING SELF A TWO WEEKS VACATION IS BARELY BETTER
DanielKahneman_2010-0050858-0051468.wav THE ONE WEEK VACATION BECAUSE THERE ARE NO NEW MEMORIES ADDED YOU HAVE NOT CHANGED THE STORY
DanielKahneman_2010-0051468-0052833.wav AND IN THIS WAY TIME IS ACTUALLY THE CRITICAL VARIABLE THAT DISTINGUISHES OUR REMEMBERING SELF FROM HER EXPERIENCING HER TIME HAS VERY LITTLE IMPORT ON THE STORY
DanielKahneman_2010-0052995-0053809.wav NOW THE REMEMBERING SELF DOES MORE THAN REMEMBER TELL STORIES IT IS ACTUALLY THE ONE THAT MAKES DECISIONS
DanielKahneman_2010-0053809-0054789.wav BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE A PATIENT WHO HAS HAD SAY TWO MILLION OSCOPES WITH TWO DIFFERENT SURGEONS AND IS DECIDING WHICH OF THEM TO CHOOSE THEN
DanielKahneman_2010-0054789-0055575.wav THE ONE THAT CHOOSES THE ONE THAT HAS IN OTHER MEMORY THAT IS LESS BAD AND THAT'S THE TRUTH THE SURGEON THAT WILL BE CHOSEN
DanielKahneman_2010-0055575-0056897.wav THE EXPERIENCING SELF HAS NO VOICE IN THIS CHOICE WE ACTUALLY DON'T CHOOSE BETWEEN EXPERIENCES WE CHOOSE BETWEEN MEMORIES OF EXPERIENCES AND EVEN WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE
DanielKahneman_2010-0056897-0057703.wav WE DON'T THINK OF OUR FUTURE NORMALLY AS EXPERIENCES WE THINK OF OUR FUTURE AS ANTICIPATED MEMORIES
DanielKahneman_2010-0057703-0058236.wav AND BEASTLY YOU CAN LOOK AT THIS IS A TYRANNY OF THE REMEMBERING SELF
DanielKahneman_2010-0058236-0059058.wav AND YOU CAN THINK OF THE REMEMBERING SELF SORT OF DRAGGING THE EXPERIENCING SELF TO EXPERIENCES THAT THE EXPERIENCING SELF DOES NOT NEED
DanielKahneman_2010-0059058-0059728.wav I HAVE THAT SENSE THAT WHEN WE GO ON VACATIONS THIS IS VERY FREQUENTLY THE CASE THAT IS THAT IT
DanielKahneman_2010-0059728-0060310.wav WE WE GO ON VACATIONS TO A VERY LARGE EXTENT IN THE SERVICE OF OUR REMEMBERING SELF
DanielKahneman_2010-0060408-0060748.wav AND THIS IS BUT HOW TO JUSTIFY A THING I KNOW
DanielKahneman_2010-0060748-0061566.wav HOW MUCH DO WE CONSUME OUR MEMORIES THAT IS ONE OF THE EXPLANATION THAT IS GIVEN FOR THE DOMINANCE OF THE REMEMBERING SELF
DanielKahneman_2010-0061566-0062483.wav WHEN I THINK ABOUT THAT I THINK ABOUT A VACATION WE HAD IN ANTARCTIC A FEW YEARS AGO WHICH WAS CLEARLY THE JUSTIFICATION OF EVERARD AND I THINK OF IT MYSELF
DanielKahneman_2010-0062483-0062883.wav RELATIVE TO HOW MUCH I THINK OF OTHER VACATIONS
DanielKahneman_2010-0062883-0064420.wav I'D PROBABLY HAVE CONSUMED MY MEMORIES OF THAT THREE WEEKS TRIP I WOULD SAY FOR ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MINUTES IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS NOW YOU KNOW IF I HAD EVER OPENED THE FOLDER WITH THE SIX HUNDRED PICTURES IN IT I WOULD HAVE SPENT ANOTHER HOUR
DanielKahneman_2010-0064420-0064847.wav NOW THAT IS THREE WEEKS AND THAT IS MOST AN HOUR AND A HALF
DanielKahneman_2010-0064847-0065787.wav THERE SEEMS TO BE A DISCREPANCY I MAY BE A BIT EXTREME IN OUR INHERENT APPETITE I HAVE FOR CONSUMING MEMORIES BUT EVEN IF YOU DO MORE OF US
DanielKahneman_2010-0065787-0066105.wav THERE IS A GENUINE QUESTION
DanielKahneman_2010-0066105-0067307.wav WHY DO WE PUT SO MUCH WEIGHT ON MEMORY RELATIVE TO THE WEIGHT THAT WE PUT ON EXPERIENCES SO I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT
DanielKahneman_2010-0067307-0068102.wav IMAGINE THAT FOR YOUR NEXT OCCASION YOU KNOW THAT AT THE END OF THE VACATION ALL YOUR PICTURES WILL BE DESTROYED
DanielKahneman_2010-0068102-0068883.wav AND YOU'LL GET AN EASY JOB SO THAT YOU WON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING NOW WOULD YOU CHOOSE THE SAME VOCATION
DanielKahneman_2010-0068883-0069413.wav AND IF AND IF YOU WOULD CHOOSE A DIFFERENT VACATION
DanielKahneman_2010-0069413-0070484.wav THERE IS A CONFLICT BETWEEN YOUR TWO SOULS AND YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO ADJUDICATE THE CONFLICT AND IT'S ACTUALLY NOT AT ALL OBVIOUS BECAUSE IF YOU THINK IN TERMS OF TIME
DanielKahneman_2010-0070484-0071310.wav THEN YOU GET ONE ANSWER AND IF YOU THINK IN TERMS OF MEMORIES YOU MIGHT GET ANOTHER ANSWER
DanielKahneman_2010-0071310-0072107.wav WHY DO WE MAKE THEM THE VACATIONS WE DO IS A PROBLEM THAT CONFRONTS US YOU KNOW WITH A CHOICE BETWEEN THE TWO CELLS
DanielKahneman_2010-0072107-0073167.wav NOW THE TWO SELVES BRING UP TWO NOTIONS OF HAPPINESS THERE ARE REALLY TWO CONCEPTS OF HAPPINESS THAT WE CAN APPLY ONE PERSON
DanielKahneman_2010-0073167-0074077.wav AND SO YOU CAN ASK HOW HAPPY IS THE EXPERIENCING SELF AND THEN YOU WOULD ASK HOW HAPPY OF THE MOMENTS IN THE EXPERIENCING SELF LIFE
DanielKahneman_2010-0074077-0075091.wav AND THERE ARE HAPPINESS FOR MOMENTS IS A FAIRLY COMPLICATED PROCESS ONE OF THE EMOTIONS THAT CAN BE MEASURED AND BY THE WAY NOW WE ARE CAPABLE OF
DanielKahneman_2010-0075091-0075676.wav GETTING A PRETTY GOOD IDEA OF THE HAPPINESS OF THE EXPERIENCING SELF OVERTIME
DanielKahneman_2010-0075859-0077361.wav IF YOU ASK FOR THE HAPPINESS OF THE REMEMBERING SELF IT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THING THIS IS NOT ABOUT HOW HAPPY A PERSON LIVES IT IS ABOUT HOW SATISFIED OR PLEASED THE PERSON IS WHEN THAT PERSON THINKS ABOUT HER LIFE
DanielKahneman_2010-0077361-0078381.wav VERY DIFFERENT NOTIONS ANYONE WHO DOESN'T DISTINGUISH THOSE NOTIONS IS GOING TO MESS UP THE STUDY OF HAPPINESS AND I BELONG TO A CROWD OF STUDENTS OF WELL BEING
DanielKahneman_2010-0078381-0079856.wav WHO HAVE BEEN MISSING UP THE STUDY OF HAPPINESS FOR A LONG TIME IN PRECISELY THIS WAY THAT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE HAPPINESS OF THE EXPERIENCING SELF AND THE SATISFACTION OF THE REMEMBERING SELF HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED IN RECENT YEARS
DanielKahneman_2010-0079856-0081150.wav AND THERE ARE NOW EFFORTS TO MEASURE THE TWO SEPARATELY THE GALLOP ORGANIZATION HAS A WORLD POLE WITH MORE THAN HALF A MILLION PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THEY THINK OF THEIR LIFE AND ABOUT
DanielKahneman_2010-0081150-0082087.wav THEIR EXPERIENCES AND THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER EFFORTS ALONG THOSE LINES SO IN RECENT YEARS WE HAVE BEGUN TO LEARN ABOUT THE HAPPINESS OF THE TWO CELLS
DanielKahneman_2010-0082087-0082668.wav AND THE MAIN LESSON I THINK WE HAVE LEARNED IS THAT THEY ARE REALLY DIFFERENT
DanielKahneman_2010-0082668-0083634.wav YOU CAN KNOW HOW SATISFIED SOMEBODY IS WITH THEIR LIFE AND THAT REALLY DOESN'T TEACH YOU MUCH ABOUT HOW THEY ARE LIVING THEIR LIFE
DanielKahneman_2010-0083634-0084866.wav AND VICE VERSA YOU KNOW JUST TO GIVE YOUR SENSE OF THE CORRELATION THE CORRELATION IS ABOUT POINT FIVE WITH THAT MEANS AS IF YOU MET SOMEBODY AND YOU WERE TOLD OH HIS FATHER IS SIX FEET TALL
DanielKahneman_2010-0084866-0085895.wav HOW MUCH WOULD YOU KNOW ABOUT HIS HEIGHT WELL YOU WOULD KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THIS HEIGHT BUT THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY YOU HAVE THAT MUCH UNCERTAINTY IF I TELL YOU THAT SOMEBODY
DanielKahneman_2010-0085895-0086702.wav RANK THEIR LIFE EIGHT ON A SCALE OF TEN YOU HAVE A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW HAPPY THEY ARE WITHOUT EXPERIENCING SELF
DanielKahneman_2010-0086702-0088235.wav SO THE CORRELATION IS LOW WE KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT CONTROL SATISFACTION OF THE HAPPINESS OF WE KNOW THAT MONEY IS VERY IMPORTANT GOLDS ARE VERY IMPORTANT WE KNOW THAT HAPPINESS IS MAINLY
DanielKahneman_2010-0088235-0088560.wav BEING SATISFIED WITH PEOPLE THAT WE LIKE
DanielKahneman_2010-0088560-0089669.wav SPENDING TIME WITH PEOPLE THAT WE LIKE THERE ARE OTHER PLEASURES BUT THIS IS DOMINANT SO IF YOU WANT TO MAXIMISE THE HAPPINESS OF THE TWO CELLS YOU ARE GOING TO END UP DOING VERY DIFFERENT THINGS
DanielKahneman_2010-0089669-0090768.wav THE BOTTOM LINE OF WHAT I SAID HERE IS THAT WE REALLY SHOULD NOT THINK OF HAPPINESS AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR WELL BEING IT IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT NOTION
DanielKahneman_2010-0090899-0091716.wav NOW VERY QUICKLY ANOTHER REASON WE CANNOT THINK STRAIGHT ABOUT HAPPINESS IS THAT
DanielKahneman_2010-0091927-0093025.wav WE DO NOT ATTEND THE SAME THINGS WHEN WE THINK ABOUT LIFE AND WE ACTUALLY LIVE SO IF YOU ASK THE SIMPLE QUESTION OF HOW HAPPY PEOPLE ARE IN CALIFORNIA
DanielKahneman_2010-0093025-0094224.wav YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GET TO THE CORRECT ANSWER WHEN YOU ASK THAT QUESTION YOU THINK PEOPLE MUST BE HAPPIER IN CALIFORNIA IF YOU SAY YOU LIVE IN OHIO AH
DanielKahneman_2010-0094224-0095275.wav AND WHAT HAPPENS IS WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT LIVING IN CALIFORNIA YOU ARE THINKING OF THE CONTRAST BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND OTHER PLACES
DanielKahneman_2010-0095275-0096588.wav AND THAT CONTRAST SAYS IN CLIMATE WELL IT TURNS OUT THAT CLIMATE IS NOT VERY IMPORTANT TO THE EXPERIENCING SELF AND IS NOT EVEN VERY IMPORTANT TO THE REFLECTIVE SELF THAT DECIDES HOW HAPPY PEOPLE ARE
DanielKahneman_2010-0096588-0097057.wav BUT NOW BECAUSE THE REFLECTIVE SELF IS IN CHARGE
DanielKahneman_2010-0097057-0098070.wav YOU MAY END UP SOME PEOPLE MAY END UP MOVING TO CALIFORNIA AND IT'S SORT OF INTERESTING TO TRACE WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO PEOPLE WHO MOVE TO CALIFORNIA IN THE HOPE OF GETTING HAPPIER
DanielKahneman_2010-0098070-0098558.wav WHILE THEIR EXPERIENCING SELF IS NOT GOING TO GET HAPPIER WE KNOW THAT
DanielKahneman_2010-0098714-0099039.wav BUT ONCE THEY WILL HAPPEN THEY WILL THINK THEY ARE HAPPIER
DanielKahneman_2010-0099039-0099822.wav BECAUSE WHEN THEY THINK ABOUT IT THEY'LL BE REMINDED OF HOW HORRIBLE THE WEATHER WAS IN OHIO
DanielKahneman_2010-0099822-0100627.wav AND THEY WILL FEEL THEY MADE THE RIGHT DECISION IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO THINK STRAIGHT ABOUT WELL BEING
DanielKahneman_2010-0100627-0101099.wav I HOPE I HAVE GIVEN YOUR SENSE OF HOW DIFFICULT IT IS THANK YOU
DanielKahneman_2010-0101553-0101804.wav I HEAR THERE IS AN EPISODE
DanielKahneman_2010-0102006-0102484.wav THANK YOU SO MUCH NOW WHEN WE WERE ON THE PHONE MA'AM TWO WEEKS AGO
DanielKahneman_2010-0102484-0103049.wav YOU MENTIONED TO ME THAT THERE WAS QUITE AN INTERESTING RESULT CAME OUT OF THAT GALLOP SURVEY
DanielKahneman_2010-0103049-0103421.wav THAT IS CERTAINLY THAT YOU CAN SHARE SINCE YOU DO HAVE A FEW MOMENTS
DanielKahneman_2010-0103421-0104644.wav SURE AH I THINK THE MOST INTERESTING RESOLVE THAT WE FOUND IN THE GALLOP OF IS A NUMBER WHICH WE ABSOLUTELY DID NOT EXPECT TO FIND WE FOUND OUT WITH RESPECT TO THE HAPPINESS OF THE EXPERIENCING SELF
DanielKahneman_2010-0104806-0105419.wav WHEN YOU KNOW WE LOOKED AT OUR INK OUR FEELINGS VERY WITHIN COME
DanielKahneman_2010-0105419-0106844.wav AND IT TURNS OUT THAT BELOW AN INCOME OF SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR AMERICANS AND THAT'S A VERY LARGE SAMPLE OF AMERICANS LIKE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND SO IT'S LAUD REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE BELOW AN INCOME OF SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR
DanielKahneman_2010-0106844-0106939.wav FIFTY THOUSAND
DanielKahneman_2010-0106939-0107048.wav
DanielKahneman_2010-0107272-0108616.wav SIXTY THOUSAND SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR PEOPLE ARE UNHAPPY AND THEY GET PROGRESSIVELY UNHAPPY OF THE POORER THEY GET ABOVE THAT WE GET AN ABSOLUTELY FLAT LINE I MEAN I'VE REALLY SEEN LINE SO FLAT
DanielKahneman_2010-0108616-0109448.wav CLEARLY WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS MONEY DOES NOT BUY YOUR EXPERIENTIAL HAPPINESS BUT LACK OF MONEY CERTAINLY BY YOUR MISERY
DanielKahneman_2010-0109448-0109936.wav AND WE CAN MEASURE THAT MISERY VERY VERY CLEARLY IN TERMS
DanielKahneman_2010-0109936-0110809.wav THE OTHER SELF REMEMBERING SELF YOU GET A DIFFERENT STORY THE MORE MONEY YOU ARE THE MORE SATISFIED YOU ARE THAT DOES NOT HOLD FOR EMOTION
DanielKahneman_2010-0110809-0111390.wav BUT DUMMY BEAT THE YOUNG WHOLE AMERICAN ENDEAVORS ABOUT IN A LIVELY PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS
DanielKahneman_2010-0111501-0112274.wav IF PEOPLE TOOK SERIOUSLY THAT FINDING IT SEEMS TO TURN UPSIDE DOWN EVERYTHING WE BELIEVE ABOUT
DanielKahneman_2010-0112274-0113273.wav FOR EXAMPLE TAXATION POLICY AND SO FORTH IS THERE ANY CHANCE THAT POLITICIANS THAT THE COUNTRY GENERALLY WOULD TAKE A FINDING LIKE THAT SERIOUSLY AND RUN PUBLIC POLICY BASED ON IT
DanielKahneman_2010-0113273-0114682.wav AND I THINK THAT THERE IS RECOGNITION OF THE RULE OF HAPPINESS RESEARCH AND PUBLIC POLICY THE RECOGNITION IS GOING TO BE SLOW IN THE UNITED STATES NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT BUT IN THE U K IT IS HAPPENING AND IN OTHER COUNTRIES THAT IS HAPPENING
DanielKahneman_2010-0114682-0115296.wav PEOPLE RECOGNIZING THAT THEY OUGHT TO BE THINKING OF POLICY AND OF HAPPINESS WHEN THEY THINK OF PUBLIC POLICY
DanielKahneman_2010-0115368-0116755.wav IT'S GOING TO TAKE A WHILE AND IT'S NOT GOING TO AND PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DEBATE WHETHER THEY WANT TO STUDY EXPERIENCE HAPPINESS OR WHETHER THEY WANT TO STUDY LIFE IN VALUATION SO WE NEED TO HAVE THAT DEBATE FAIRLY SOON HOW TO ENHANCE HAPPINESS
DanielKahneman_2010-0116755-0118016.wav GOES VERY DIFFERENT WAYS DEPENDING ON HOW YOU THINK AND WHETHER YOU THINK OF THE REMEMBERING SELF OR YOU THINK OF THE EXPERIENCING SELF THIS IS GOING TO INFLUENCE POLICY I THINK IS TO COME IN THE UNITED STATES EFFORTS ARE BEING MADE
DanielKahneman_2010-0118016-0118829.wav TO MEASURE THE EXPERIENCE OF THE POPULATION THIS IS GOING TO BE I THINK WITHIN THE NEXT DECADE OR TWO PART OF NATIONAL STATISTICS
DanielKahneman_2010-0118829-0119225.wav WELL IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THIS ISSUE WILL OR SHOULD BE
DanielKahneman_2010-0119225-0119831.wav THE MOST INTERESTING POLICY DISCUSSION TO TRACK OVER THE NEXT FEARS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR INVENTING BEHAVIOUR
DanielKahneman_2010-0119831-0119944.wav EFFECTS OF ANY CONGRU
EricMead_2009P-0001843-0003166.wav FOR SOME TIME I HAVE BEEN INTERESTED IN THE POSSIBLE EFFECT WHICH MIGHT SEEM LIKE AN ODD THING FOR A MAGICIAN TO BE INTERESTED IN UNLESS YOU THINK OF IT IN THE TERMS THAT I DO WHICH IS A SOMETHING VAGUE
EricMead_2009P-0003166-0004567.wav IS BELIEVED IN ENOUGH BY SOMEBODY THAT IT BECOMES SOMETHING REAL IN OTHER WORDS SUGAR PILLS HAVE A MEASURABLE EFFECT IN CERTAIN KINDS OF STUDIES AH THE PERCEVAL EFFECT JUST BECAUSE THE PERSON THINKS
EricMead_2009P-0004567-0006338.wav THAT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THEM IS A PHARMACEUTICAL OR A M SOME SORT OF AA FOR PAIN MANAGEMENT FOR EXAMPLE IF THEY BELIEVE IT ENOUGH THERE'S IMMEASURABLE EFFECT IN THE BODY CALLED THE PERCEVAL EFFECT SOMETHING FAKE BECOME SOMETHING REAL BECAUSE OF SOMEONE'S PERCEPTION OF IT
EricMead_2009P-0006338-0008004.wav AH IN ORDER FOR US TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER I WANT A START BY SHOWING YOU A RUDIMENTARY VERY SIMPLE MAGIC TRICK AND I'LL SHOW YOU HOW IT WORKS THIS THE TRICK THAT'S BEEN IN EVERY CHILDREN'S MAGIC BOOK SINCE AT LEAST THE NINETEEN FIFTIES I LEARNED IT MYSELF FROM CUBSCOT MAGIC IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTY
EricMead_2009P-0008004-0008997.wav I'LL DO IT FOR YOU AND THEN I'LL EXPLAIN IT AND THEN I'LL EXPLAIN WHY I EXPLAINED IT YES SO I HEARS IT HAPPENS THE KNIFE WHICH YOU COULD EXAMINE MY HAND WHICH YOU COULD EXAMINE
EricMead_2009P-0008997-0009949.wav I CAN'T HOLD THE KNIFE IN MY FISTS LIKE THIS I CAN'T I'LL GET MY SLEEVE BACK AND I'LL TO MAKE SURE NOTHING GOES UP OR DOWN MY SLEEVE I'M JUST GOING TO SQUEEZE MY WRIST RIGHT HERE I
EricMead_2009P-0009949-0010780.wav THAT WAY YOU CAN SEE THAT AT NO TIME CAN ANYTHING TRAVEL AS LONG AS I AM SQUEEZING THERE NOTHING CAN GO UP OR DOWN MY SLEEVE AND THE OBJECT OF THIS IS QUITE SIMPLE
EricMead_2009P-0010870-0011388.wav AH I'M GOING TO OPEN MY HAND AND HOPE IF ALL IS WELL
EricMead_2009P-0011408-0012109.wav MY PURE ANIMAL MAGNETISM WILL HOLD THE KNIFE IN FACT IS HELD SO TIGHTLY IN PLACE THAT I CAN SHAKE IT
EricMead_2009P-0012109-0013091.wav AND THE KNIFE DOES NOT COME OFF NOTHING GOES UP OR DOWN MY SLEEVE NO TRICKERY AND YOU CAN EXAMINE EVERYTHING CUT
EricMead_2009P-0013346-0014883.wav SO THIS IS A TRICK THAT I OFTEN TEACH TO YOUNG CHILDREN THAT ARE INTERESTED IN MAGIC BECAUSE YOU CAN LEARN A GREAT DEAL ABOUT DECEPTION BY STUDYING THIS VERY EVEN THOSE OF VERY SIMPLE TRICK METHOD LOGICALLY PROBABLY MANY OF YOU IN THE ROOM KNOW THIS TRICK BUT WHAT HAPPENS IS THIS I HOLD THE KNIFE IN MY HAND
EricMead_2009P-0014883-0015996.wav I SAY I AM GOING TO GRAB HOLD OF MY WRIST TO MAKE SURE NOTHING GOES UP OR DOWN MY SLEEVE THAT IS A LIE THE REASON I'M HOLDING ON TO MY WRIST IS BECAUSE THAT'S ACTUALLY THE SECRET
EricMead_2009P-0015996-0017009.wav OF THE ILLUSION IN A MOMENT WHEN MY HAND MOVES FROM FACING YOU TO BEING AWAY FROM YOU THIS FINGER I HEAR MY INDEX FINGERS JUST IN A SHIP FROM WHERE IT IS TO A POSITION
EricMead_2009P-0017009-0017267.wav RUNNING OUT LIKE THIS
EricMead_2009P-0017267-0017433.wav NICE ONE
EricMead_2009P-0017433-0017708.wav SOMEONE WHO DIDN'T HAVE A CHILDHOOD OUT THERE
EricMead_2009P-0017876-0020001.wav SO JUST LIKE THIS FROM HERE RIGHT AND AS I MOVE AROUND MY FINGER SHIFTS SO WE CAN TALK ABOUT WHY THIS IS DECEPTIVE WHY YOU DON'T NOTICE THERE ARE ONLY THREE FINGERS DOWN HERE BECAUSE THE MIND IN THE WAY IT PROCESSES INFORMATION IT DOESN'T COUNT ONE TO THREE GROUPS THEM BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT THIS IS ABOUT RIGHT THEN I OPEN MY HAND OBVIOUSLY IT'S CLINGING THERE NOT BY ANIMAL MAGNETISM BUT BY
EricMead_2009P-0020001-0020775.wav CHICANERY MY NEXT FINGER BEING THERE AND THEN WHEN I CLOSED MY FINGER SAME THING AS I MOVED BACK
EricMead_2009P-0020775-0021668.wav THIS MOTION KIND OF COVERS THE MOVING BACK OF MY FINGER I TAKE THIS HAND AWAY YOU GIVE THE KNIFE OUT THERE'S A TRICK YOU CAN DO FOR YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS NOW
EricMead_2009P-0021744-0022069.wav WHAT IS THAT TO DO WITH THE PERCEVAL EFFECT WELL
EricMead_2009P-0022286-0023119.wav I READ A STUDY A YEAR OR SO AGO THAT REALLY BLEW MY MIND WIDE OPEN I'M NOT A DOCTOR RESEARCHER SO THIS TO ME WAS AN ASTONISHING THING
EricMead_2009P-0023119-0025228.wav TURNS OUT THAT IF YOU ADMINISTER A PLACEBO IN THE FORM OF A WHITE PILL THAT'S LIKE A ASPIRIN SHAPED JUST A ROUND WHITE PILL IT HAS SOME CERTAIN MEASURABLE EFFECT BUT IF YOU CHANGE THE FORM THAT YOU GIVE THE PUSSIMBO IN LIKE YOU MAKE A SMALLER PILL AND COLOR IT BLUE AND STAMP A LETTER INTO IT IT IS ACTUALLY MEASURABLY MORE EFFECTIVE
EricMead_2009P-0025228-0026154.wav EVEN THOUGH NEITHER ONE OF THESE THINGS HAS IN ANY FORM A SUITABLE PLACE THEIR SUGAR PILLS BUT A WHITE PILL IS NOT AS GOOD AS A BLUE PILL A LITTLE OF WHAT
EricMead_2009P-0026202-0026914.wav THAT REALLY PUT ME OUT TURNS OUT THOUGH THAT'S NOT EVEN WHERE IT STOPS IF YOU ARE TO HAVE CAPITALS
EricMead_2009P-0026914-0028352.wav THEY ARE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN TABLETS IN ANY FORM A COLORED CAPSULE THAT YELLOW ON ONE END AND RED ON THE OTHER IS BETTER THAN A WHITE CAPSULE DOSAGE HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THIS YOU KNOW ONE PILL TWICE A DAY IS NOT AS GOOD AS THREE PILLS
EricMead_2009P-0028352-0028677.wav I DON'T REMEMBER THAT IT IS THE POINT IS
EricMead_2009P-0028883-0029617.wav THESE DOTAGES HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT AND THE FORM HAS SOME FIGURE AND IF YOU WANT THE ULTIMATE IN A PLACEBO YOU GO TO THE NEEDLE
EricMead_2009P-0029617-0031316.wav RIGHT A SYRINGE WITH SOME INERT COUPLECES OF SOME INERT SOMETHING IN YOU INJECT THIS INTO A PATIENT WHILE THIS IS SUCH A POWERFUL IMAGE IN THEIR MIND THAT IT IS SO MUCH STRONGER THAN THE WHITE PILL THAT IT REALLY THIS GRAFT ON A WELL I'LL SHOW IT TO YOU SOME OTHER TIME WHEN WE HAVE SLIDES THE POINT IS
EricMead_2009P-0031463-0032676.wav THE WHITE PILL IS NOT AS GOOD AS THE BLUE PILL IS NOT AS GOOD AS THE CAPSULE IS NOT AS GOOD AS THE NEEDLE AND NONE OF IT HAS ANY REAL ACETICAL QUALITY IT'S ONLY YOUR BELIEF THAT MAKES IT REAL
EricMead_2009P-0032676-0034050.wav IN YOUR BODY AND MAKES A STRONGER EFFECT I WANTED TO SEE IF I COULD TAKE THAT IDEA AND APPLY IT TO A MAGIC TRICK AND TAKE SOMETHING THAT IS OBVIOUSLY A FAKE TRICK AND MAKE IT SEEM REAL
EricMead_2009P-0034369-0035504.wav AND WE KNOW FROM THAT STUDY THAT WHEN YOU WANT REALITY YOU GO TO THE NEEDLE THIS IS A SEVEN INCH HAT PIN VERY VERY SHARP
EricMead_2009P-0035504-0036061.wav AND I'M GOING TO JUST STERILIZE A TINY BIT
EricMead_2009P-0036061-0037489.wav THIS IS REALLY MY FLESH THIS IS NOT DAMIEN'S SPECIAL GROWN FLESH THAT'S MY SKIN RIGHT THERE THIS IS NOT A HOLLYWOOD SPECIAL EFFECT I'M GOING TO PIERCE MY SKIN AND RUN THIS NEEDLE THROUGH TO THE OTHER SIDE
EricMead_2009P-0037489-0039466.wav IF YOU'RE QUEASY EH IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE FAINT EASY I WAS DOING THIS FOR SOME FRIENDS IN THE HOTEL ROOM LAST NIGHT SOME PEOPLE THAT I DIDN'T KNOW AND ONE WOMAN NOT ALMOST PASSED OUT SO I SUGGEST IF YOU'RE ME IF YOU GET QUEASY EASY THAT LOOK AWAY FOR ABOUT THE NEXT THIRTY IN FACT I KNOW IT I'LL DO THE FIRST BAD PART BEHIND IT YOU'LL GET TO SEE YOU CAN LOOK AWAY TO IF YOU LIKE TO
EricMead_2009P-0039466-0040275.wav SO HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS RIGHT HERE AT THE BEGINNING OF MY FLESH AH AT THE LOWER PART OF MY ARM I JUST MAKE A LITTLE PIERCE
EricMead_2009P-0040275-0041208.wav I'M SORRY MAN THAT I MIGHT FRIGHTEN YOU OUT I CAN'T AND THEN JUST THROUGH MY SKIN A TINY BIT AND OUT THE OTHER SIDE LIKE THIS
EricMead_2009P-0041397-0041759.wav NOW WE WERE IN THE SAME POSITION WE WERE IN WITH THE KNIFE TRICK
EricMead_2009P-0042253-0042396.wav SORT OF
EricMead_2009P-0042396-0043267.wav BUT YOU CAN'T COUNT MY FINGERS RIGHT NOW CANYONS BY SELIM IS SHOWN TO YOU THAT'S ONE TWO THREE FOUR
EricMead_2009P-0043514-0044266.wav I KNOW WHAT PEOPLE THINK WHEN THEY SEE THIS THEY GO WELL HE WOULD CERTAINLY NOT DUMB ENOUGH TO STAB HIMSELF THROUGH THE SKIN TO ENTERTAIN US FOR A FEW MINUTES
EricMead_2009P-0044329-0044521.wav SAW ME GIVE YOU LITTLE PIG
EricMead_2009P-0044613-0044815.wav HAS THAT LOOK OUT THERE PRETTY GOOD
EricMead_2009P-0045043-0045125.wav
EricMead_2009P-0045303-0046443.wav AT THE PEOPLE IN THE BACK O K I DIDN'T REALLY SEE THE PEOPLE IN SATELLITE RUMOR LIKE STARTING TO MOVE IN NOW WE GIVE YOU A GOOD CLOSE LOOK AT THIS THAT REALLY IS MY SKIN THAT IS NOT A HOLLYWOOD SPECIAL EFFECT THAT'S MY FLESH
EricMead_2009P-0046443-0047040.wav AND I CAN TWIST IT AROUND I'M SORRY I DON'T IF YOU'RE GETTING CRAZY LOOK AWAY DON'T LOOK AT IT THEN
EricMead_2009P-0047040-0047574.wav GIGGLE IN THE BACK OR PEOPLE ON FIDIO YEARS FROM NOW WATCHING THE CIGARETTE THAT LOOKS KIND OF NEAT
EricMead_2009P-0047574-0048181.wav SOME SORT OF EFFECT BUT IF IT WERE REAL HE WOULD BE SEEN AS A WHOLE THERE IN A HOLE THERE IF IT WERE REAL HE WOULD BE BLEEDING
EricMead_2009P-0048181-0048374.wav LET ME WORK UP SOME BLOOD FOR YOU
EricMead_2009P-0048831-0049097.wav
EricMead_2009P-0051216-0052077.wav NORMALLY NOW I WOULD TAKE THE NEEDLE OUT I WOULD CLEAN MY ARM AND I WOULD SHOW YOU THAT THERE ARE NO WOUNDS BUT I THINK IN THIS CONTEXT AND WITH THE IDEA OF
EricMead_2009P-0052077-0052750.wav TAKING SOMETHING FIT AND MAKING IT INTO SOMETHING REAL I WAS GOING TO LEAVE IT THERE AND WALK OFF THE STAGE
EricMead_2009P-0053024-0053644.wav I WILL BE SEEING YOU SEVERAL TIMES OF THE NEXT FEW DAYS I HOPE YOU ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT THANK YOU
GaryFlake_2010-0001605-0002712.wav IF I CAN LEAVE YOU WITH ONE BIG IDEA TO DAY IT'S THAT THE WHOLE OF THE DATA IN WHICH WE CONSUME IS GREATER THAN THE SUM OF THE PARTS AND INSTEAD OF THINKING ABOUT INFORMATION OVERLOAD
GaryFlake_2010-0002712-0004072.wav WHAT I'D LIKE YOU TO THINK ABOUT IS HOW WE CAN USE INFORMATION TO THAT PATTERN'S POP AND WE CAN SEE THINGS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE INVISIBLE SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT RIGHT HERE IS A TYPICAL MORTALITY CHART ORGANIZED BY AGE THIS
GaryFlake_2010-0004072-0005245.wav TRUE THAT AMUSING HERE IS A LITTLE EXPERIMENT THAT'S CALLED PIVOT AND WITH PIVOT WHAT I CAN DO IS I CAN CHOOSE TO FILTER ON ONE PARTICULAR CAUSE OF DEATH SAY ACCIDENTS AND RIGHT AWAY I SEE THERE'S A DIFFERENT PATTERN THAT EMERGES
GaryFlake_2010-0005245-0006253.wav THIS IS BECAUSE IN THE MID ERA HERE PEOPLE ARE THEIR MOST ACTIVE AND OVER HERE THEY ARE MOST FRAIL WE CAN STEP BACK OUT AGAIN AND THEN REORGANIZE THE DATA BY CAUSE OF DEATH
GaryFlake_2010-0006253-0007070.wav SEEING THAT CIRCULATORY DISEASES AND CANCERS ARE THE USUAL SUSPECTS BUT NOT FOR EVERYONE IF WE GO AHEAD AND WE FILL HER
GaryFlake_2010-0007070-0007797.wav BY AGE SAY FORTY YEARS OR LESS WE SEE THAT ACCIDENTS ARE THE GREATEST CAUSE THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO BE WORRIED ABOUT
GaryFlake_2010-0007797-0008762.wav AND WE DRONED THAT IT'S ESPECIALLY THE CASE FOR THAT SO YOU GET THE IDEA THAT VIEWING INFORMATION VIEWING IT IN THIS WAY IS A LOT LIKE
GaryFlake_2010-0008762-0009589.wav SWIMMING IN A LIVING INFORMATION INHOGRAPHIC AND IF WE CAN DO THIS FOR RAW DATA WHY NOT DO IT FOR CONTENT AS WELL
GaryFlake_2010-0009589-0010306.wav SO WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT HERE IS THE COVER OF EVERY SINGLE SPORT ILLUSTRATED EVER PRODUCED
GaryFlake_2010-0010306-0011591.wav IT'S ALL HERE IT'S ALL IN THE WEB YOU CAN GO BACK YOUR ROOMS AND TRY THIS AFTER MY TALK WITH PIVOT YOU CAN DRILL INTO A DECADE YOU CAN DRILL INTO A PARTICULAR YEAR YOU CAN JUMP RIGHT INTO A SPECIFIC ISSUE
GaryFlake_2010-0011591-0012755.wav SO I'M LOOKING AT THIS I SEE THE ATHLETES THAT HAVE APPEARED IN THIS ISSUE THE SPORTS ON A MAN'S ARMSTRONG FAN SO I'LL GO AHEAD IN A CLICK ON THAT WHICH REVEALS FOR ME ALL THE ISSUES IN WHICH MAN'S ARMSTRONGS MEN ARE PART OF
GaryFlake_2010-0013068-0014141.wav NOW IF I WANTED JUST KIND OF TAKE A PEEK AT THESE I MIGHT THINK WELL WHAT ABOUT TAKING A LOOK AT ALL OF CYCLING SO I CAN STEP BACK AND EXPAND ON THAT I SEE GRUGGED LAMON NOW
GaryFlake_2010-0014141-0015469.wav AND SO YOU GET THE IDEA THAT WHEN YOU NAVIGATE OVER INFORMATION THIS WAY GOING NARROW BROADER BACKING AND BACKING OUT YOU'RE NOT SEARCHING YOU'RE NOT BROWSING YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING THAT'S ACTUALLY A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT IT'S IN BETWEEN
GaryFlake_2010-0015469-0018126.wav WE THINK IT CHANGES THE WAY INFORMATION CAN BE USED SO I WON'T EXTRAPOLATE ON THIS IDEA BUT WITH SOMETHING OF THE LITTLE THE CRAZY WHAT WE'VE DONE HERE AS WE'VE TAKEN EVERY SINGLE WICKET OF AGE AND WE REDUCED IT DOWN TO A LITTLE SUMMARY SO THE SUMMARY CONSISTS OF JUST A LITTLE SYNOPSIS AND AN ICON TO INDICATE THE TYPICAL AREA THAT IT COMES FROM I'M ONLY SHOWING THE TOP FIVE HUNDRED MOST POPULAR RICKETY OF PAGES RIGHT HERE BUT EVEN IN THIS LIMITED
GaryFlake_2010-0018126-0018976.wav WE CAN DO A LOT OF THINGS RIGHT AWAY WE GET A SENSE OF WHAT ARE THE TYPICAL DOMAINS THAT ARE MOST POPULAR IN LYCOPEDIA I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD IN SLIGHT GOVERNMENT
GaryFlake_2010-0018976-0019895.wav NOW HAVING SELECTED GOVERNMENT I CAN NOW SEE THAT THE WICKETS AND CATEGORIES THAT MOST FREQUENTLY CORRESPOND TO THAT ARE TIME MAGAZINE PEOPLE OF THE YEAR
GaryFlake_2010-0019895-0021557.wav SO THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THIS IS AN INSIGHT THAT WAS NOT CONTAINED WITHIN ANY ONE WICKET PAGE IT'S ONLY POSSIBLE TO SEE THAT INSIGHT WHEN YOU STEP BACK AND LOOK AT ALL OF THEM LOOKING AT ONE OF THESE PARTICULAR SUMMARIES I CAN THEN DRILL INTO THE CONCEPT OF
GaryFlake_2010-0021557-0022461.wav TIME MAGAZINE PERSON OF THE YEAR BRINGING UP ALL OF THEM SO LOOKING AT THESE PEOPLE I CAN SEE THAT THE MAJORITY COME FROM GOVERNMENT
GaryFlake_2010-0022461-0022945.wav SOME HAVE COME FROM NATURAL SCIENCES
GaryFlake_2010-0022945-0023252.wav SOME FEWER STILL HAVE COME FROM BUSINESS
GaryFlake_2010-0023317-0023585.wav THERE'S MY BOSS
GaryFlake_2010-0023711-0023977.wav ONE HAS COME FROM MUSIC
GaryFlake_2010-0024060-0024501.wav AND INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH BARNOW WAS ALSO TEN PRIZE WINNER
GaryFlake_2010-0024501-0025648.wav SO WE CAN GO JUMP AND TAKE A LOOK AT ALL TEN PRIZE WINNERS CECY WE'RE NAVIGATING THE WEB FOR THE FIRST TIME AS IF IT'S ACTUALLY A WEB NOT FROM PAGE TO PAGE BUT AT A HIGHER LEVEL OF ABSTRACTION
GaryFlake_2010-0025648-0026888.wav AND SO I WANT TO SHOW YOU ONE OTHER THING THAT MAY CATCH A LITTLE OF IT BY SURPRISE I'M JUST SHOWING THE NEWER TIME'S WEBS OUT HERE SO PIVOT THIS APPLICATION I DON'T WANT TO CALL A BROWSER REALLY NOT A BROWSER
GaryFlake_2010-0026888-0027889.wav BUT YOU CAN DO WET PAGES WITH IT AND WE BRING THAT ZUMABLE TECHNOLOGY TO EVERY SINGLE WET PAGE LIKE THIS SO I CAN STEP BACK
GaryFlake_2010-0027889-0029249.wav OPERATE BACK INTO A SPECIFIC SECTION NOW THE REASON WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE BY VIRTUE OF JUST VIEWING WET PAGES IN THIS WAY I CAN LOOK IT IN MY ENTIRE BROWSING HISTORY IN THE EXACT SAME WAY SO I CAN DRILL INTO WHAT I HAVE DONE
GaryFlake_2010-0029249-0030180.wav OVER SPECIFIC TIME FRAMES HERE IN FACT IS THE STATE OF ALL THE DEMOS THAT I JUST GAVE AND I CAN SORT OF REPLACE HIMSELF THAT I WAS LOOKING AT EARLIER TO DAY
GaryFlake_2010-0030180-0030858.wav AND IF I WANT TO STEP BACK AND LOOK AT EVERYTHING I CAN INDICE MY HISTORY PERHAPS BY MY SEARCH HISTORY
GaryFlake_2010-0030858-0031869.wav HERE IS DOING SOME NEPOTISTIC SEARCHING LOOKING FOR BEING OVER HERE FOR LIVE LAPSED PIVOT AND FROM THESE I CAN DRILL INTO THE WEBS AND JUST LAUNCH THEM AGAIN IT'S ONE MATTER FOR
GaryFlake_2010-0031869-0032556.wav REPARP IS MULTIPLE TIMES AND IN EACH CASE IT MAKES THE WHOLE GREATER THAN THE SUM OF THE PARTS WITH THE DATA SO
GaryFlake_2010-0032556-0033425.wav RIGHT NOW IN THIS WORLD WE THINK ABOUT DATE AS BEING THIS CURSE WE TALK ABOUT THE CURSE OF INFORMATION OVERLOAD WE TALK ABOUT
GaryFlake_2010-0033425-0033991.wav DROWNING IN DATA WHAT IF WE CAN TURN THAT UPSIDE DOWN AND TURN THE WEB UPSIDE DOWN
GaryFlake_2010-0033991-0035282.wav SO THAT INSTEAD OF NAVIGATING FROM ONE THING TO THE NEXT WE GET USED TO THE HABIT OF BEING ABLE TO GO FROM MANY THINGS TO MANY THINGS AND THEN BEING ABLE TO SEE THE PATTERNS THAT WERE OTHERWISE HIDDEN IF WE CAN DO THAT INSTEAD
GaryFlake_2010-0035282-0036714.wav OF BEING TRACT AND DATA WE MIGHT ACTUALLY EXTRACT INFORMATION AND INSTEAD OF DEALING JUST WITH INFORMATION WE CAN TEASE OUT KNOWLEDGE AND IF WE GET THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE MAY BE THESE FROM THOSE WISDOM TO BE FOUND SO THAT I THANK YOU
JamesCameron_2010-0001675-0002796.wav I GREW UP ON STEADY DIET OF SCIENCE FICTION IN HIGH SCHOOL I TOOK A BUST OF SCHOOL AN HOUR EACH WAY EVERY DAY AND I WAS ALWAYS ABSORBED IN A BOOK

JamesCameron_2010-0004181-0004572.wav IN OUR COUNTRY ALSO MANIFESTED ITSELF IN THEM
JamesCameron_2010-0004572-0005155.wav THE FACT THAT WHENEVER I WAS IN SCHOOL I WAS I WAS OUT IN THE WOODS HIKING AND TAKING
JamesCameron_2010-0005155-0006248.wav SAMPLES OF FROGS AND SNAKES AND BUGS AND POND WATER AND BRING IT BACK LOOKING AT IT UNDER THE MICROSCOPE I WAS AND ALL I WAS REAL SCIENCE HE WAS ALL ABOUT TRYING TO UNDERSTAND
JamesCameron_2010-0006248-0007081.wav UNDERSTAND THE WORLD UNDERSTAND THE LIMITS OF POSSIBILITY AND MY LOVE OF SCIENCE FICTION
JamesCameron_2010-0007081-0007718.wav ACTUALLY SEEMED TO BE MIRRORED IN THE WORLD AROUND ME BECAUSE WHAT WAS HAPPENING WAS IN THE LATE SIXTIES
JamesCameron_2010-0007718-0009147.wav AH IN ALL WE WERE WE WERE GOING TO THE MOON WE WERE EXPLORING THE OCEANS A JACQUES WAS COMING INTO OUR LIVING ROOMS WITH HIS AMAZING SPECIALS THAT SHOWED US ANIMALS AND PLACES IN THE AIR A WONDROUS WORLD THAT WE COULD NEVER REALLY HAVE
JamesCameron_2010-0009147-0009668.wav PREVIOUSLY IMAGINED SO THAT SEEMED TO RESONATE WITH THE WHOLE SCIENCE FICTION PART OF IT
JamesCameron_2010-0009668-0011129.wav AND I WAS A AN ARTIST I COULD DRAW LIKE PAINT AND I I FOUND THAT BECAUSE THERE WEREN'T IN ALL VITIO GAMES AND THE SATURATION OF SAGEY MOVIES AND ALL OF THIS IMAGERY IN THE MEDIAL LANDSCAPE
JamesCameron_2010-0011129-0012357.wav I HAD TO CREATE THESE IMAGES IN MY HEAD I DON'T WE ALL DID AS KIDS HAVING TO READ A BOOK AND THROUGH THE AUTHOR'S DESCRIPTION PUT SOMETHING ON ON THE SCREEN OF THE MOVIE SCREEN IN OUR HEADS AND SO MY
JamesCameron_2010-0012357-0013647.wav RESPONSE TO THIS WAS TO PAINT TO DRAW ALIEN CREATURE'S ALIEN WORLD'S ROBOTS SPACESHIPS ALL THAT STUFF I WAS ENDLESSLY GETTING BUSTED IN MOUTH CLASPED IN A DAWDLING BEHIND THE TEXT BOOK AND
JamesCameron_2010-0013647-0014515.wav THAT WAS THE CREATIVITY HAD TO FIND ITS OUTLET SOMEHOW AND AN INTERESTING THING HAPPENED THAT THE JACQUES CRUSOE
JamesCameron_2010-0014515-0015778.wav SHOWS AH NOW SHE GOT ME VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE FACT THAT THERE WAS AN ALIEN WORLD RIGHT HERE ON EARTH I MIGHT NOT REALLY GO TO AN ALIEN WORLD ON A SPACESHIP SOME DAY AND THAT SEEMED PRETTY ON PRETTY DARN UNLIKELY
JamesCameron_2010-0015778-0016681.wav BUT I COULD THAT WAS A WORLD I COULD REALLY GO TO RIGHT HERE ON EARTH THAT WAS AS RICH AND EXOTIC AS ANYTHING I HAD IMAGINED AH FROM READING THESE BOOKS
JamesCameron_2010-0016681-0017803.wav SO I DECIDED I WAS GOING TO BECOME A SKUA DIVER AT THE AGE OF FIFTEEN AND THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THAT WAS THAT I LIVED IN A LITTLE VILLAGE IN CANADA SIX HUNDRED MILES FROM THE NEAREST OCEAN
JamesCameron_2010-0017803-0018791.wav BUT I DIDN'T LET THAT DAUNT ME AH I PESTERED MY FATHER UNTIL HE FINALLY FOUND A SCOOP AT LAST IN A BUFFALO NEW YORK RIGHT ACROSS THE BORDER FROM WHERE WE LIVE
JamesCameron_2010-0018791-0019437.wav THEN I ACTUALLY GOT CERTIFIED A IN A POOL AT A Y M C A IN THE DEAD OF WINTER IN BUFFALO NEW YORK
JamesCameron_2010-0019437-0020430.wav I DIDN'T SEE THE OCEAN A A REAL OCEAN FOR ANOTHER TWO YEARS UNTIL WE MOVED TO CALIFORNIA AND NOW SINCE THEN AND ON THE IN THE INTERVENING
JamesCameron_2010-0020430-0021481.wav FORTY YEARS I'VE I'VE SPENT ABOUT THREE THOUSAND HOURS UNDER WATER AND FIVE HUNDRED HOURS OF THAT WAS INSUBMERCIBLES AND I'VE LEARNED THAT
JamesCameron_2010-0021481-0022229.wav THAT THAT DEEP OCEAN ENVIRONMENT AND EVEN THE SHALLOW OCEANS ARE SO RICH AND WITH THE AMAZING LIFE
JamesCameron_2010-0022229-0022873.wav THERE REALLY IS BEYOND BEYOND OUR IMAGINATION AND NATURE'S IMAGINATION IS SO
JamesCameron_2010-0022873-0024014.wav SO BOUNDLESS COMPARED TO OUR OWN A MEAGRE HUMAN IMAGINATION I STILL TO THIS DAY STAND IN ABSOLUTE AWE OF WHAT I SEE WHEN I MAKE THESE DIVES AND MY LOVE AFFAIR WITH THE OCEAN
JamesCameron_2010-0024014-0024754.wav IS ON GOING IN AND JUST AS STRONG AS IT EVER WAS BUT I WENT OUT WHEN I CHOSE PRAYER AS AN ADULT TUB
JamesCameron_2010-0024754-0025256.wav IT WAS STILL MAKING AND THAT SEEMED TO BE THE BEST WAY TO RECONCILE
JamesCameron_2010-0025256-0026705.wav THIS URGE I HAD TO TELL STORIES WITH MY MY URGES TO CREATE IMAGES AND I WAS AS A KID CONSTANTLY DRAWN COMIC BOOKS AND SAW IT SO STILL MAKING WAS THE WAY TO PUT PICTURES AND STORIES TOGETHER AND THAT MADE SENSE AND OF COURSE THE STORIES
JamesCameron_2010-0026705-0027848.wav I CHOSE TO TELL WHERE SCIENCE FICTION STORIES TERMINATED ALIENS THEN THE ABYSS AND WITH THE ABYSS AH I WAS PUTTING TOGETHER MY LOVE OF UNDER WATER AND DIVING WITH FILM MAKING SO
JamesCameron_2010-0027848-0028533.wav MERGING THE TWO PASSIONS SOMETHING INTERESTING CAME OUT OF THE ABYSS
JamesCameron_2010-0028533-0029382.wav THAT TO SOLVE A SPECIFIC NARRATIVE PROBLEM ON THAT FILM WHICH WAS TO CREATE THIS KIND OF LIQUID WATER CREATURE
JamesCameron_2010-0029382-0030136.wav AH WE ACTUALLY EMBRACED A COMPUTER A GENERATED ANIMATION AC AND A
JamesCameron_2010-0030136-0031025.wav THIS THIS RESULTED IN THE FIRST SOFT SURFACE CHARACTER SEE THE ANIMATION THAT WAS EVER IN A MOVIE
JamesCameron_2010-0031025-0032997.wav AND EVEN THOUGH FILM DID MAKE ME MONEY OH BERRY BROKE EVEN I SHOULD SAY I WITNESSED SOMETHING AMAZING WHICH IS THAT THE AUDIENCE THE GLOBAL AUDIENCE WAS MESMERIZED BY THIS APPARENT MAGIC YOU KNOW IT'S ARTHUR CLARKE'S LAW THAT ANY SUFFICIENTLY ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY IS INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM MAGIC THEY WERE SEEING SOMETHING MAGICAL
JamesCameron_2010-0032997-0034378.wav AND SO THAT THAT THAT GOT ME VERY EXCITED I THOUGHT WELL THIS IS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE EMBRACED INTO THE CINEMATIC ART SO WITH THE TERMINATOR TO WHICH WAS MY NEXT FILM WE TOOK THAT MUCH FARTHER WORKING WITH ILEM WE CREATED THE LIQUID METAL
JamesCameron_2010-0034378-0035683.wav DUDE IN THAT FILM THAT SUCCESS HUNG IN THE BALANCE ON WHETHER THAT EFFECT WOULD WORK AND IT DID AND WE CREATED MAGIC AGAIN AND WE HAD THE SAME RESULT ON WITH AN AUDIENCE ALTHOUGH WE DID MAKE A LITTLE MORE MONEY ON THAT WAY
JamesCameron_2010-0035683-0036761.wav NOW DRAW A LINE THROUGH THOSE TWO DOTS OF EXPERIENCE CAME TO THIS THIS IS GOING TO BE A WHOLE NEW WORLD THIS IS A WHOLE NEW WORLD OF CREATIVEITY FOR
JamesCameron_2010-0036761-0037793.wav FOR FILM ARTISTS SO I I STARTED A COMPANY WITH STAMMERINGS TO MY GOOD FRIEND SAM WINSTON WHO WAS A THE PREMIER MAKE UP AND IN CREATURE DESIGNER
JamesCameron_2010-0037793-0039422.wav AH AT THAT TIME AND IT WAS CALLED DIGITAL DOMAIN AND THE CONCEPT OF THE COMPANY WAS THAT WE WOULD LEAP FROG PAST THE KIND OF ANALOGUE PROCESSES OF OPTICAL PRINTERS AND SO ON WE WOULD GO RIGHT TO DIGITAL PRODUCTION AND WHEN SHE DID THAT IT GAVE US A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE FOR A WHILE
JamesCameron_2010-0039422-0040288.wav BUT WE FOUND OURSELVES LAGGING IN IN THE MIDNIGHT IN THE CREATURE AND CHARACTER DESIGNED STUFF THAT WE HAD ACTUALLY FOUNDED THE COMPANY TO DO
JamesCameron_2010-0040288-0040961.wav SO I WROTE THIS PIECE CALLED AVATAR WHICH WAS MEANT TO ABSOLUTELY PUSH THE ENVELOPE
JamesCameron_2010-0040961-0042394.wav OF VISUAL EFFECTS OF SEDGY EFFECTS BEYOND WITH REALISTIC A HUMAN MOTIVE A CHARACTER IS GENERATED IN C G IN THE MAIN CHARACTERS OF ALL THE INSIGNIA AND THE WORLD WOULD BE INSIGNIA AND A
JamesCameron_2010-0042394-0043693.wav NOW THE ENVELOPE PUSHED BACK AND I WAS TOLD BY A LIT THE FOLKS AT MY COMPANY THAT WE WEREN'T GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS FOR A WHILE SO I SHELVED IT AND I MADE THIS OTHER MOVIE ABOUT A BIG SHIP THAT SIX
JamesCameron_2010-0043766-0044544.wav AND YOU KNOW I WENT AND PUT IT TO THE STUDIO AS ROMEO AND JULIET ON A SHIP THAT'S GOING TO BE THIS EPIC ROMANCE PASSIONATE
JamesCameron_2010-0044544-0045285.wav THE FILM SECRETLY WHAT I WANTED TO DO WAS I WANTED TO DIVE TO THE REAL WRECK OF TITANIC AND THAT'S WHY I MADE THE MOVE
JamesCameron_2010-0045701-0047036.wav AND THAT'S THE TRUTH NOW STUDIO DIDN'T KNOW THAT BUT I CONVINCED THEM I SAID I SAID WE'RE GOING TO DIVE TO THE WRECK WE GOT A FILM IT FOR REAL WE'LL BE USING IT IN THE OPENING OF THE FILM IT'LL BE REALLY IMPORTANT TO BE A GREAT MARKING HOOK AND I TALKED THEM INTO FUNDING AN EXPEDITION
JamesCameron_2010-0047209-0048197.wav SOUNDS CRAZY BUT THIS GOES BACK TO THAT THEME ABOUT YOU KNOW YOUR IMAGINATION CREATING A REALITY WHOSE ACTION CREATED A REALITY WHERE SIX MONTHS LATER I FOUND MYSELF IN A RUSSIAN SUBMERSIBLE
JamesCameron_2010-0048197-0048951.wav TWO AND A HALF MILES DOWN IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC LOOKING AT THE REAL TITANIC THROUGH A VIEWPORT NOT A MOVIE NOT A H D FOR REAL
JamesCameron_2010-0049251-0050136.wav NOW THAT THAT BLEW MY MIND AND YOU KNOW IT TOOK A LOT OF PREPARATION WE HAD TO BUILD CAMERAS AND LIGHTS AND ALL KINDS OF THINGS BUT IT STRUCK ME HOW MUCH THIS
JamesCameron_2010-0050136-0051700.wav DIVE THESE DEEP DIVES WAS LIKE A LIKE A SPACE MISSION YOU KNOW WHERE IT WAS IT WAS HIGHLY TECHNICAL AND A REQUIRED ENORMOUS PLANNING AND YOU GET IN THIS CAPSULE YOU GO DOWN TO THIS DARK HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT WHERE THERE'S NO HOPE OF RESCUE IF YOU CAN'T GET BACK BY YOURSELF
JamesCameron_2010-0051700-0052297.wav AND YOU KNOW I'VE THOUGHT NOW I'M LIKE LIVING IN A SCIENCE FICTION MOVIE THIS IS REALLY COOL
JamesCameron_2010-0052297-0053526.wav AND SO I REALLY GOT BITTEN BY THE BUG OF DEEP OCEAN EXPLORATION OF COURSE THE CURIOSITY THE SCIENCE COMPONENT OF IT IT WAS EVERYTHING IT WAS ADVENTURE IT WAS CURIOSITY WAS IMAGINATION AND IT WAS AN EXPERIENCE
JamesCameron_2010-0053526-0054687.wav THAT HOLLYWOOD COULDN'T GIVE ME CAUSE YOU KNOW I COULD IMAGINE A CREATURE WE COULD CREATE A VISUAL EFFECT FOR IT BUT I COULDN'T IMAGINE WHAT I WAS SEEING OUT THAT WINDOW AS WE DID SOME OF OUR SUBSEQUENT EXPEDITIONS
JamesCameron_2010-0054687-0056291.wav I WAS SEEING CREATURES AT HYDROTHERMAL VANSON AND SOMETIMES THINGS THAT I HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE SOMETIMES THINGS THAT NO ONE HAD SEEN BEFORE THAT ACTUALLY WERE NOT DESCRIBED BY SCIENCE AT THE TIME THAT WE SAW THEM AND IMAGED THEM SO I WAS COMPLETELY SMITTEN BY THIS
JamesCameron_2010-0056291-0057780.wav AND HAD TO DO MORE AND SO I ACTUALLY MADE A KIND OF CURIOUS DECISION AFTER THE SUCCESS OF TITANIC I SAID I CAN'T OMIT A PARK MY DAY JOB AS A HOLLYWOOD MOVIE MAKER AND I WANT TO GO BE A FULL TIME EXPLORER FOR A WHILE
JamesCameron_2010-0057780-0059409.wav AND SO WHEN WE STARTED PLANNING THESE EXPEDITIONS AND WE WENT UP GOING TO THE BIZMARCH AND AND EXPLORING IT WITH THE ROMANTIC VEHICLES WE WENT BACK TO THE TITANIC WRECK WE TOOK LITTLE SPOTS THAT WE HAD CREATED THAT SPOILED A FIBRE OPTIC
JamesCameron_2010-0059409-0060516.wav AND THAT THE IDEA WAS TO GO IN INTO AN INTERIOR SURVEY OF THAT SHIP AH WHICH HAD NEVER BEEN DONE NOBODY EVER LOOKED INSIDE THE RECORD AND HAVE THE MEANS TO DO IT SO WE CREATED TECHNOLOGY TO DO IT
JamesCameron_2010-0060516-0061650.wav TO YOU KNOW HERE I AM NOW ON THE DECK OF TITANIC SITTING IN A SUBMERSIBLE AND LOOKING OUT AT PLANKS THAT LOOKED MUCH LIKE THIS WHERE I KNEW THAT THE BAND HAD PLAYED
JamesCameron_2010-0061650-0062708.wav AND I'M FLYING A LITTLE ROMANTIC VEHICLE THROUGH THE CORRIDOR OF THE SHIP YOU KNOW WHEN I SAY I'M I'M OPERATING IT BUT MY MIND IS IN THE VEHICLE
JamesCameron_2010-0062708-0063644.wav I FELT LIKE I WAS PHYSICALLY PRESENT INSIDE THE SHIPWRECK OF TITANIC AND IT WAS THE MOST CEREAL CANADAJAVO EXPERIENCE I EVER HAD BECAUSE
JamesCameron_2010-0063644-0064675.wav I WOULD KNOW BEFORE I TURNED A CORNER WHAT WAS GOING TO BE THERE BEFORE THE LIGHTS OF THE VEHICLE ACTUALLY REVEALED IT BECAUSE I HAD WALKED THE SET FOR MONTHS WHEN WE WERE MAKING THE MOVE
JamesCameron_2010-0064675-0065602.wav AND THE SET WAS BASED AS AN EXACT REPLICA ON THE BLUE PRINTS OF THE SHIP SO THERE WAS THIS REMARKABLE EXPERIENCE IN IT REALLY
JamesCameron_2010-0065602-0066346.wav MADE ME REALIZE THAT YOU'LL TELL THE PRESENT EXPERIENCE THAT YOU ACTUALLY CAN HAVE THESE ROMANTIC AVATARS IN YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS
JamesCameron_2010-0066346-0067623.wav AS IT IS INJECTED INTO THE INTO THE VEHICLE INTO THIS THIS OTHER FORM OF EXISTENCE IT WAS REALLY REALLY QUITE PROFOUND AND IT MAY BE A LITTLE BIT OF A GLIMPSE TO TO WHAT MIGHT BE HAPPENING TO SOME DECADES OUT AS A
JamesCameron_2010-0067623-0069120.wav AS WE START TO HAVE A SIDEBOARD BODY IS FOR EXPLORATION OR FOR OTHER MEANS AND IN MANY SORT OF A POST HUMAN FUTURES THAT I CAN IMAGINE AS A SCIENCE FIXING THEM SO HAVING DONE THESE THESE ZOB
JamesCameron_2010-0069120-0070141.wav OUR EXPEDITIONS AH AND AND IN A REALLY BEGINNING TO APPRECIATE WHAT WAS DOWN THERE SUCH AS THAT AT THE DEEP OCEAN VENT WHERE WE HAD THESE
JamesCameron_2010-0070141-0070987.wav AMAZING AMAZING ANIMALS THERE ARE BASICALLY ALIENS RIGHT HERE ON EARTH THEY LIVE IN A AN ENVIRONMENT OF CHEMICAL SYNTHESIS THEY DON'T SURVIVE
JamesCameron_2010-0070987-0072201.wav ON SUNLIGHT BASED SYSTEM AWAY WE DO AND SO YOUR SEEING ANIMALS THAT ARE LIVING NEXT TO FIVE HUNDRED DEGREES CENTIGRADE WATER PLUMES THAT YOU THINK THEY CAN'T POSSIBLY EXIST AT THE SAME TIME
JamesCameron_2010-0072254-0072878.wav I WAS GETTING VERY INTERESTED IN SPACE SCIENCE AS WELL AGAIN NOW AS THE SCIENCE FICTION INFLUENCE AS A KID
JamesCameron_2010-0072878-0074496.wav AND I WENT UP GETTING INVOLVED WITH THE SPACE COMMUNITY REALLY INVOLVED WITH THAT WITH NASSA SITTING ON THE NASS ADVISERRY BOARD PLANNING A ACTUAL SPACE MISSIONS GOING TO RUSSIA GOING THROUGH THE PRE COSMO NOT BY A MEDICAL PROTOCOL AND ALL THESE SORTS OF THINGS
JamesCameron_2010-0074496-0075594.wav TO ACTUALLY GO AND FLY TO THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION WITH OUR THREE D CAMERA SYSTEMS AND THIS WAS FASCINATING BUT WHAT I WANT OF DOING WAS BRINGING SPACE SCIENTISTS WITH US INTO THE DEEP
JamesCameron_2010-0075594-0076495.wav AND TAKING THEM DOWN SO THAT THEY HAD ACCESS AS TO BIOLOGISTS PLANETARY SCIENCES PEOPLE WHO WERE INTERESTED IN THESE EXTREME OF FINE ENVIRONMENT
JamesCameron_2010-0076495-0077585.wav TAKING THEM DOWN TO THE FENCE AND LETTING THEM SEE AND TAKE SAMPLES AND TEST INSTRUMENTS AND SO ON SO HERE WE WERE MAKING DOCUMENTARY FILMS BUT ACTUALLY DOING SCIENCE AND ACTUALLY DOING SPACE SCIENCE
JamesCameron_2010-0077585-0078414.wav I COMPLETELY CLOSED THE LOOP BETWEEN BEING THE SCIENCE FICTION FAN YOU KNOW AS A KID AND DOING THE STUFF FOR REAL
JamesCameron_2010-0078414-0079453.wav AND IN A LONG WAY IN THIS JOURNEY OF DISCOVERY I LEARNED A LOT I LEARNED A LOT ABOUT SCIENCE BUT I ALSO LEARNED A LOT ABOUT
JamesCameron_2010-0079453-0080336.wav LEADERSHIP AND YOU THINK THE DIRECTOR'S GOT TO BE A LEADER LEADER OF NEON CAPTAIN THE SHIP ALL THAT'S WORTHING I'D REALLY LEARN ABOUT LEADERSHIP UNTIL
JamesCameron_2010-0080400-0081340.wav I DID THESE EXPEDITIONS BECAUSE I HAD TO AT A CERTAIN POINT SAY WHAT AM I DOING OUT HERE WHY AM I DOING THIS WHAT DO I GET OUT OF
JamesCameron_2010-0081340-0082831.wav WE DON'T MAKE MONEY AT THESE DAM SHOWS AND WHEN WE BARELY BREAK EVEN THERE'S NO FAME IN IT PEOPLE SAY TO THINK I WENT AWAY BETWEEN TITANIC AND AVATAR AND WAS BUFFING MY NAILS SOME PLACE YOU KNOW SITTING AT THE BEACH MADE ALL THESE FILMS MADE ALL THESE DOCUMENTARY FILMS THAT YOU DON'T FORGET
JamesCameron_2010-0082831-0083636.wav LIMITED AUDIENCE NO FAME NO GLORY NO MONEY WHAT ARE YOU DOING YOU'RE DOING IT FOR THE TASK ITSELF FOR THE CHALLENGE
JamesCameron_2010-0083636-0084543.wav AND THE OCEAN IS THE MOST CHANGING ENVIRONMENT THERE IS FOR THE THRILL OF DISCOVERY AND FOR THAT STRANGE BOND THAT HAPPENS
JamesCameron_2010-0084543-0085373.wav WHEN A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE FORMED A TIGHTLY KNIT MASS WE WOULD DO THESE THINGS WITH TEN TWELVE PEOPLE WORKING FOR YEARS AT A TIME
JamesCameron_2010-0085373-0086199.wav SOMETIMES AT SEA FOR FOR TWO THREE MONTHS AT A TIME AND IN THAT BOND YOU REALISE THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
JamesCameron_2010-0086199-0086699.wav IS THE RESPECT THAT YOU HAVE FOR THEM THAT THEY HAVE FOR YOU THAT YOU HAVE DONE A TASK
JamesCameron_2010-0086699-0088026.wav THAT YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN TO SOME ONE ELSE WHEN YOU COME BACK TO THE SHORE AND YOU SAY WE DON'T WE HAD TO DO THIS AND THE FIBRE OPTIC AND THE ATTENUATION AND THIS AND THAT ALL THE TECHNOLOGY OF IT AND THE DIFFICULTY THE HUMAN PERFORMANCE ASPECTS OF WORKING AT SEA
JamesCameron_2010-0088026-0089464.wav YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN IT TO PEOPLE IT'S THAT THING THAT MAY BE COPSE HAVE OUR PEOPLE IN IN COMBAT THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH SOMETHING TOGETHER AND THEY KNOW THEY CAN NEVER EXPLAIN IT CREATES A BOND CREAKS A BOND OF RESPECT SO WHEN I CAME BACK TO MAKE MY NEXT MOVIE WHICH WAS AVATAR
JamesCameron_2010-0089464-0090687.wav I TRIED TO APPLY THAT SAME PRINCIPLE OF LEADERSHIP WHICH IS THAT YOU RESPECT YOUR TEAM AND YOU ARE IN THEIR RESPECT IN RETURN AND IT REALLY CHANGED THE DYNAMIC SO HERE I WAS AGAIN WITH A SMALL TEAM
JamesCameron_2010-0090687-0091838.wav AND YOU KNOW AN UNCHARTED TERRITORY DOING AMATEUR COMING UP WITH NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT DIDN'T EXIST BEFORE TREMENDOUSLY EXCITING AH TREMENDOUSLY CHALLENGING AND WE BECAME A FAMILY
JamesCameron_2010-0091838-0093533.wav OVER A FOUR AND A HALF YEAR PERIOD A COMPLETELY CHANGED HOW I DO MOVIE SO PEOPLE HAVE COMMENTED ON HOW YOU IN A WAY YOU BROUGHT BACK THE OCEAN OF ORGANISMS AND PUT THEM ON THE PLANET OF PANDORA TO ME IT WAS MORE THE FUNDAMENTAL WAY OF DOING BUSINESS THE PROCESS ITSELF THAT CHANGED AS A RESULT OF THAT
JamesCameron_2010-0093533-0094908.wav SO WHAT CAN WE SAY TO SIZE OUT OF ALL THIS YOU KNOW WHAT'S THAT ONE OF THE LESSONS LEARN WELL I THINK NUMBER ONE IS CURIOSITY IT'S THE MOST POWERFUL THING YOU OWN IMAGINATION
JamesCameron_2010-0094908-0096211.wav IS A FORCE THAT CAN ACTUALLY MANIFEST A REALITY AND THE RESPECT OF YOUR TEAM IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ALL THE LAURELS IN THE WORLD
JamesCameron_2010-0096287-0096507.wav I HAVE YOUNG FILM MAKERS
JamesCameron_2010-0096507-0096894.wav COME UP TO ME AND SAY AND GIVE ME SOME ADVICE FOR DOING THIS
JamesCameron_2010-0096894-0097074.wav AND I SAID
JamesCameron_2010-0097074-0098428.wav DON'T PUT LIMITATIONS ON YOURSELF OTHER PEOPLE WILL DO THAT FOR YOU DON'T DO IT TO YOURSELF DON'T BET AGAINST YOURSELF AND AND TAKE RISKS A MANASSA HAS THIS HAS THIS A PHRASE THAT THEY LIKE FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION
JamesCameron_2010-0098428-0099454.wav BUT FAILURE HAS TO BE AN OPTION IN ART AND AN EXPLORATION BECAUSE IT IS A LEAP OF FAITH AND NO IMPORTANT ENDEAVOUR THAT REQUIRED INNOVATION
JamesCameron_2010-0099454-0100510.wav WAS DONE WITHOUT RISK YOU HAVE TO BE WILLING TO TAKE THOSE RISKS SO THAT'S THE THOUGHT I WOULD LEAVE YOU WITH IS IT IN WHATEVER YOU ARE DOING FAILURE
JamesCameron_2010-0100510-0101065.wav IS AN OPTION BUT FEAR IS NOT THINKING
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0001547-0003185.wav I'M WELL I'M GAME DESIGNER I'VE BEEN MAKING GAMES ON MINE NOW FOR TEN YEARS AND MY GOAL FOR THE NEXT DECADE IS TO TRY TO MAKE IT AS EASY TO SAVE THE WORLD IN REAL LIFE AS IT IS TO SAVE THE WORLD IN ALL MY GAMES
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0003185-0003953.wav NOW I HAVE A PLAN FOR THIS AND IT ENTAILS CONVINCING MORE PEOPLE INCLUDING ALL OF YOU TO SPEND MORE TIME
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0003953-0004822.wav PLAYING BIGGER AND BETTER GAMES RIGHT NOW WE SPEND THREE HOURS A WEEK PLAYING ON LINE GAMES SOME OF YOU MIGHT BE THINKING
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0004822-0006200.wav THAT'S A LOT OF TIME TO SPEND PLAYING GAMES MAY BE TOO MUCH TIME CONSIDERING HOW MANY URGENT PROBLEMS WE HAVE TO SOLVE IN THE REAL WORLD AND BUT ACTUALLY ACCORDING TO MY RESEARCH AT THE INSTITUTE FOR THE FUTURE IT'S ACTUALLY THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0006200-0006901.wav THREE MILLION HOURS A WEEK IS NOT NEARLY ENOUGH GAME PLAY TO SOLVE THE WORLD'S MOST URGENT PROBLEMS AND IN FACT
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0006901-0008015.wav I BELIEVE THAT IF WE WANT TO SURVIVE THE NEXT CENTURY ON THIS PLANET WE NEED TO INCREASE THAT TOTAL DRAMATICALLY I'VE CALCULATED THE TOTAL WE NEED AT TWENTY ONE MILLION HOURS OF GAME PLAY EVERY WEEK
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0008015-0009135.wav SO THAT'S PROBABLY A BIT OF A COUNTER INTUITIVE IDEA SO I'LL JUST I'LL SAY IT AGAIN LET IT SINK IN IF WE WANT TO SAW PROBLEMS LIKE HUNGER POVERTY CLIMATE CHANGE GLOBAL CONFLICT OBESITY
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0009135-0009939.wav I BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO ASPIRE TO PLAY GAMES ALL MINE FOR AT LEAST TWENTY ONE MILLION HOURS A WEEK BY THE END OF THE NEXT YEAR
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0009939-0010122.wav NO I'M SERIOUS
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0010122-0011067.wav I AM HERE IS WHY THIS PICTURE PRETTY MUCH SUMS UP WHY I THINK GAMES ARE SO ESSENTIAL TO THE FUTURE SURVIVAL OF THE HUMAN SPECIES TRULY
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0011067-0012090.wav THIS IS A PORTRAIT BY A PHOTOGRAPHER NAMED PHIL TO DANA HE WANTED TO CAPTURE THE EMOTION OF GAMING SO HE SET UP A CAMERA IN FRONT OF GAMES WHILE THEY WERE PLAYING AND THIS IS A CLASSIC
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0012090-0012997.wav GAINING EMOTION NOW IF YOU'RE NOT A GAMER YOU MIGHT MISS SOME OF THE NUANCES IN THIS PHOTO YOU PROBABLY SEE THE SENSE OF URGENCY A LITTLE BIT OF
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0012997-0015153.wav FEAR BUT INTENSE CONCENTRATION DEEP DEEP FOCUS ON TACKLING A REALLY DIFFICULT PROBLEM AND IF YOU ARE A GAME OR YOU WILL NOTICE A FEW NUANCES HERE THE CRINKLE OF THE EYES UP AND AROUND THE MOUTH IS A SIGN OF OPTIMISM AND THE EYEBROWS UP IS SURPRISED THIS IS A GAMEER WHO'S ON THE VERGE OF SOMETHING CALLED AN EPOCH WHEN
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0015267-0016700.wav OH YOU HEARD OF THAT OKAY GOOD SO WE HAVE SOME NEIGHBORS AMONG US SO AN EPICTION IS AN OUTCOME THAT IS SO EXTRAORDINARILY POSITIVE YOU HAD NO IDEA IT WAS EVEN POSSIBLE UNTIL YOU ACHIEVED IT AH IT WAS ALMOST BEYOND THE THRESHOLD OF IMAGINATION
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0016700-0017159.wav AND WHEN YOU GET THERE YOU ARE SHOCKED TO DISCOVER WHAT YOU'RE TRULY CAPABLE OF THAT'S AN EPIC
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0017159-0018374.wav THIS IS A GAME OR ON THE VERGE OF AN EPIC WIND AND THIS IS THE FACE THAT WE NEED TO SEE ON MILLIONS OF PROBLEMS ALL OVER THE WORLD AS WE TRY TO TACKLE THE OBSTACLES OF THE NEXT CENTURY THE FACE OF SOMEONE
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0018374-0019692.wav WHO AGAINST ALL ODDS IS ON THE VERGE OF AN EPIC WIND NOW UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS MORE OF THE FACE THAT WE SEE IN EVERYDAY LIFE NOW AS WE TRY TO TACKLE URGENT PROBLEMS THIS IS WHAT I CALL THE I'M NOT GOOD AT LIFE FACE AND IS ACTUALLY ME
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0019692-0022947.wav MAKING IT CAN YOU SEE IT YES GOOD I'M THIS SEXUALLY MEAN MAKING THE I'M NOT GOOD AT LIFE'S FACE ON THIS IS A PIECE OF GRIFFINTI IN MY OLD NEIGHBORHOOD IN BERKELEY CALIFORNIA WHERE I DID MY PEACH D ON WHY WE'RE BETTER IN GAMES THAN WE ARE IN REAL LIFE AND THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT A LOT OF GAMERS HAVE WE FEEL THAT WE ARE NOT AS GOOD IN REALITY AS WE ARE IN GAMES AND I DON'T MEAN JUST GOOD AS IN SUCCESSFUL ALTHOUGH THAT'S PART OF IT WE DO ACHIEVE MORE IN GAME WORLDS BUT I DON'T MEAN GOOD AS IN'T IT'S TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S INSPIRED TO COOPERATE AND TO COOPERATE WHEN WE ARE IN GAMES
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0022947-0024137.wav I BELIEVE THAT MANY OF US BECOME THE BEST VERSION OF OURSELVES THE MOST LIKELY TO HELP AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE THE MOST LIKELY TO STICK WITH THE PROBLEM AS LONG AS IT TAKES TO GET UP AFTER FAILURE AND TRY AGAIN AND IN REAL LIFE
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0024137-0025275.wav WHEN WE ARE WHEN WE FACE FAILURE WHEN WE CONFRONT OBSTACLES WE OFTEN DON'T FEEL THAT WAY WE FEEL OVERCOME WE FEEL OVERWHELMED WE FEEL ANXIOUS MAYBE DEPRESSED FRUSTRATED OR CYNICAL
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0025275-0026562.wav WE NEVER HAVE THOSE FEELINGS ON OUR PLAYING GAMES THEY JUST DON'T EXIST IN GAMES SO THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO STUDY WHEN I WAS A GRADUATE STUDENT WHAT ABOUT GAMES MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO FEEL THAT WE CAN'T ACHIEVE EVERYTHING HOW CAN WE
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0026562-0027737.wav TAKE THOSE FEELINGS FROM GAMES AND APPLY THEM TO REAL WORLD WORK THEY LOOK AT GAMES LIKE WORLD OF WARCRAFT WHICH IS REALLY THE IDEAL COLLABORATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING ENVIRONMENT AND I STARTED TO NOTICE A FEW THINGS THAT MAKE
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0027737-0029044.wav EPIC WINDS SO POSSIBLE IN ALL NINE WORLDS SO THE FIRST THING IS WHENEVER YOU SHOW UP IN ONE OF THESE ALL NIGHT GAMES ESPECIALLY IN WORLD OF WARCRAFT THERE ARE LOTS AND LOTS OF DIFFERENT CHARACTERS WHO ARE WILLING TO TRUST YOU WITH A WORLD SAVING MISSION
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0029044-0030073.wav RIGHT AWAY BUT NOT JUST ANY MISSION IS A MISSION THAT IS PERFECTLY MATCHED WITH YOUR CURRENT LEVEL IN THE GAME RIGHT SO YOU CAN DO IT THEY NEVER GIVE YOU A CHALLENGE THAT YOU CAN ACHIEVE
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0030073-0030993.wav BUT IT IS ON THE VERGE OF WHAT YOU'RE CAPABLE OF SO YOU HAVE TO TRY HARD BUT THERE'S NO UNEMPLOYMENT IN WORLD OF WARCRAFT THERE'S NO SITTING AROUND WRINGING YOUR HANDS IS ALWAYS SOMETHING SPECIFIC
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0030993-0031600.wav AND IMPORTANT TO BE DONE AND THERE ARE ALSO TONS OF CLARETERS EVERYWHERE YOU GO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0031600-0032864.wav READY TO WORK WITH YOU TO ACHIEVE YOUR EPIC MISSION AS NOT SOMETHING WE HAVE IN REAL LIFE THAT EASILY THE SUNSET AT OUR FINGER TIPS OUR TONS OF COLLABORATORS AND ALSO THERE IS AN EPIC STORY THIS INSPIRING STORY IF I WERE THERE
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0032864-0034288.wav AND WHAT WE'RE DOING AND THEN WE GET ALL THIS POSITIVELY BACK YOU GUYS HAVE HEARD OF LEVELLING UP AND PLUS ONE'S STRENGTH AND PLUS ONE'S INTELLIGENCE OH WE DON'T GET THE KIND OF CONSTANT FEE BACK IN REAL LIFE WHEN I GET OFF THE STAGE I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE YOU KNOW PLUS ONE SPEAKING AND PLUS ONE
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0034288-0035286.wav CRAZY IDEA AND PLUS TWENTY CRAZY IDEA AND I DON'T GET THAT FEE BACK IN REAL LIFE I'M NOW THE PROBLEM WITH COLLABORATIVE ON LINE OF ARMIES LIKE THE WORLD OF WAR CRAFT
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0035286-0037175.wav IS THAT IT'S SO SATISFYING TO BE ON THE VERGE OF AN EPIGRAM ALL THE TIME THAT WE DECIDE TO SPEND ALL OUR TIME IN THESE GAME WORLDS IS JUST BETTER THAN REALITY SO SO FAR ON COLLECTIVELY ALL THE WORLD OF WARCRAFT GAMERS HAVE SPENT FIVE POINT NINE THREE MILLION YEARS SOLVING THE VIRTUAL PROBLEMS OF AZARATH NOW
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0037175-0037995.wav THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY A BAD THING IT MIGHT SOUND LIKE A BAD THING BUT TO PUT THAT IN CONTEXT FIVE POINT NINE THREE MILLION YEARS AGO WAS WHEN
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0037995-0039167.wav OUR EARLIEST PRIMATE HUMAN ANCESTORS STOOD UP THAT WAS THE FIRST UPRIGHT PRIMATE O K SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HOW MUCH TIME WERE CURLY INVESTING AND PLAYING GAMES
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0039167-0040609.wav THE ONLY WAY IT MAKES SENSE TO THINK ABOUT IT IS TO TALK ABOUT TIME AT THE MAGNITUDE OF HUMAN EVOLUTION AND WHICH IS AN EXTRAORDINARY THING BUT IT'S ALSO APT BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THAT BY SPENDING ALL THE TIME PLAYING GAMES WERE ACTUALLY CHANGING
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0040609-0041625.wav WHAT WE ARE CAPABLE OF AS HUMAN BEINGS WE ARE EVOLVING TO BE A MORE COLLABORATIVE AND HEARTY SPECIES THIS IS TRUE I BELIEVE SO CONSIDER THIS REALLY INTERESTING STATISTIC
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0041625-0042427.wav IT WAS RECENTLY PUBLISHED BY RESEARCH AND CARNEGIE MELON UNIVERSITY THE AVERAGE YOUNG PERSON TO DAY IN A COUNTRY WITH A STRONG GAME OR CULTURE
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0042427-0043461.wav WILL HAVE SPENT TEN THOUSAND HOURS PLAYING ON MY GAMES BY THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE NOW TEN THOUSAND HOURS IS A REALLY INTERESTING NUMBER FOR TWO REASONS FIRST OF ALL
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0043461-0044623.wav FOR CHILDREN IN THE UNITED STATES TEN THOUSAND AND EIGHTY HOURS IS THE EXACT AMOUNT OF TIME YOU WILL SPEND IN SCHOOL FROM FIFTH GRADE TO HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION IF YOU HAVE PERFECT ATTENDANCE
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0044623-0045642.wav SO WE HAVE AN ENTIRE PARALLEL TRACK OF EDUCATION GOING ON WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE LEARNING AS MUCH ABOUT WHAT IT TAKES TO BE A GOOD GAMER AS LEARNING ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE IN SCHOOL
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0045642-0046931.wav SOME OF YOU HAVE PROBABLY READ MALCOLM GLADWELL'S NEW BOOK OUTLINES SO YOU WOULD HAVE HEARD OF HIS THEORY OF SUCCESS THE TEN THOUSAND HOURS THEORY OF SUCCESS IT'S BASED ON THIS GREAT PAGAN OF SCIENCE RESEARCH THAT IF WE CAN MASTER
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0046931-0048034.wav TEN THOUSAND HOURS OF EFFORTFUL STUDY AT ANYTHING BY THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE WE WILL BE VIRTUOSIS AT IT WE WILL BE AS GOOD AT WHATEVER WE DO AS THE GREATEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD AM AND SO
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0048034-0048891.wav NOW WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS AN ENTIRE GENERATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE VIRTUOSO GAMERS SO THE BIG QUESTION IS
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0048891-0049885.wav WHAT EXACTLY OUR GAME IS GETTING SO GOOD AT BECAUSE IF WE COULD FIGURE THAT OUT WE WOULD HAVE A VIRTUALLY UNPRECEDENTED HUMAN RESOURCE ON OUR HANDS
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0049885-0051044.wav THIS IS HOW MANY PEOPLE WE ALL HAVE IN THE WORLD WHO SPEND AT LEAST AN HOUR A DAY PLAYING ON MY GAMES THESE ARE OUR VIRTUOSO GAMES FIVE HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE WHO ARE EXTRAORDINARILY GOOD AT SOMETHING
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0051044-0051590.wav AND IN THE NEXT DECADE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER BILLION GAMERS WHO ARE EXTRAORDINARY GOOD
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0051590-0052984.wav AT WHATEVER THAT IS IF YOU DON'T KNOW IT ALREADY THIS IS COMING THE GAME INDUSTRY IS DEVELOPING CONSULS THAT ARE LOW ENERGY AND THAT WORK WITH THE WIRELESS PHONE NETWORKS INSTEAD OF A BRABIAN INNER NET SO THAT GAME IS ALL OVER THE WORLD PARTICULARLY IN INDIA
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0052984-0053672.wav CHINA BRAZIL CAN GET ON LINE THEY EXPECT ONE BILLION MORE GAMES AND THE NEXT DECADE SO BRINGS UP TO ONE POINT FIVE BILLION GAMES
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0053672-0054261.wav SO I STARTED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THESE GAMES ARE MAKING US VIRTUOSIS AT HERE THE FOUR THINGS I CAME UP WITH
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0054261-0055664.wav THE FIRST IS URGENT OPTIMISM CAN THINK OF THIS AS EXTREME SELF MOTIVATION URGENT OPTIMISM IS THE DESIRE TO ACT IMMEDIATELY TO TACKLE AN OBSTACLE COMBINED WITH THE BELIEF THAT WE HAVE A REASONABLE HOPE OF SUCCESS
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0055664-0056373.wav GAMERS ALWAYS BELIEVE THAT AN EPIGRAM IS POSSIBLE AND THAT IS ALWAYS WORTH TRYING AND TRYING NOW GAME IS NOT SET AROUND
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0056373-0057463.wav THE GAMERS ARE VIRTUOSOS AT WEAVING A TIGHT SOCIAL FABRIC FOR THE LOT OF INTERESTING RESEARCH THAT SHOWS THAT WE LIKE PEOPLE BETTER AFTER WE PLAY A GAME WITH THEM EVEN IF THEY BEAT US BADLY
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0057463-0059425.wav THE REASON IS IT TAKES A LOT OF TRUST TO PLAY A GAME WITH SOME ONE WE TRUST THAT THEY WILL SPEND THEIR TIME WITH US THAT THEY WILL PLAY BY THE SAME RULES VALUE THE SAME GOAL THEY'LL STAY WITH THE GAME UNTIL IT'S OVER AND SO PLAYING A GAME TOGETHER ACTUALLY BUILDS UP BONDS AND TRUSTS AND CO OPERATION ON AND THEN WE ACTUALLY BUILD STRONGER SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS AS A RESULT
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0059425-0060796.wav BLISSFUL PRODUCTIVITY I LOVE IT IT'S A REASON WHY THE AVERAGE WORLD OF WARCRAFT GAMER PLAYS FOR TWENTY TWO HOURS A WEEK KIND OF A HALF TIME JOB IT'S BECAUSE WE KNOW WHEN WE'RE PLAYING A GAME THEY WERE ACTUALLY HAPPIER WORKING HARD THAN WE ARE
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0060796-0062073.wav RELAXING OR HANGING OUT WE KNOW THAT WE ARE OPTIMIZED AS HUMAN BEINGS TO DO HARD MEANINGFUL WORK AND GAMERS ARE WILLING TO WORK HARD ALL THE TIME IF THEY'RE GIVEN THE RIGHT WORK FINALLY EPIC MEANING
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0062073-0063491.wav GAMER'S LOVE TO BE ATTACHED TO AWE INSPIRING MISSIONS TO HUMAN PLANETARY SCALE STORIES SO JUST ONE BIT OF TRIVIA THAT HELPS PUT THAT INTO PERSPECTIVE AND SO YOU ALL KNOW WICKEY PEEDIA
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0063491-0064212.wav BIGGEST WICKEY IN THE WORLD SECOND BIGGEST WICKEY IN THE WORLD WITH NEARLY EIGHTY THOUSAND ARTICLES IS THE WORLD OF WARCRAFT WICKED
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0064212-0065979.wav FIVE MILLION PEOPLE USE IT EVERY MONTH THEY HAVE COMPILED MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WORLD OF WARCRAFT ON THE INNER NET THAN ANY OTHER TOPIC COVERED ON ANY OTHER WICKET IN THE WORLD THEY ARE BUILDING AN EPIC STORY THEY ARE BUILDING AN EPIC KNOWLEDGE RESOURCE ABOUT THE WORLD OF WARCRAFT ONLY SO THESE ARE FOUR SUPER POWERS THAT ADD UP
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0065979-0066602.wav TO ONE THING GAMERS ARE SUPER EMPOWERED HOPEFUL INDIVIDUALS
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0066602-0067935.wav THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE INDIVIDUALLY CAPABLE OF CHANGING THE WORLD AND THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE CAPABLE OF CHANGING VIRTUAL WORLDS AND NOT THE REAL WORLD THAT PROBLEM THAT I AM TRYING TO SOLVE
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0067935-0068838.wav AH THERE'S A KIND OF NAME EVER CASHRONOVA WHOSE WORK IS BRILLIANT HE LOOKS AT WHY PEOPLE ARE INVESTING SO MUCH TIME AND ENERGY AND MONEY IN ON LINE WORLDS
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0068838-0069865.wav AND HE SAYS WE'RE WITNESSING WHAT AMOUNTS TO NO LESS THAN A MASS EXODUS TO VIRTUAL WORLDS AND ON LIKE GAME ENVIRONMENTS AND HE'S AN ECONOMIST SO HE'S RATIONAL HE SAYS
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0070076-0070540.wav NOT LIKE ME I'M ASHAMED AS I AM I'M EXUBERANT BUT HE SAYS HE SAYS
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0070540-0071959.wav BUT THIS MAKES PERFECT SENSE BECAUSE GAMERS CAN ACHIEVE MORE IN ALL THE WORLD THAN THEY CAN IN REAL LIFE THEY CAN HAVE STRONGER SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS AND GAMES THAN THEY CAN HAVE IN REAL LIFE THEY GET BETTER FEET BACK AND FEEL MORE REWARDED IN GAMES THAN THEY DO IN REAL LIFE SO HE SAYS
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0071959-0072539.wav FOR NOW IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE FOR GAMERS HAS BEEN MORE TIME IN VIRTUAL WORLDS THAN THE REAL WORLD NOW
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0072539-0073742.wav I ALSO AGREE THAT THAT IS RATIONAL FOR NOW BUT IT IS NOT BY ANY MEANS AN OPTIMAL SITUATION WE HAVE TO START MAKING THE REAL WORLD MORE LIKE A GAME SO I TAKE MY INSPIRATION FROM SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0073742-0075183.wav TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED YEARS AGO THESE ARE ANCIENT DICE MADE OUT OF SHEEP'S KNUCKLES RIGHT BEFORE WE HAD OFF SOME GAME CONTROLLERS WE HAD SHEEP'S KNUCKLES AND THESE REPRESENT THE FIRST GAME EQUIPMENT DESIGNED BY HUMAN BEINGS
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0075183-0076051.wav IF YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE WORK OF THE ANCIENT GREEK HISTORIAN HERODOTUS YOU MIGHT KNOW THIS HISTORY WHICH IS THE HISTORY OF WHO INVENTED GAMES AND WHY
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0076051-0077070.wav HERODOTUS SAYS THAT GAMES PARTICULARLY DICE GAMES WERE INVENTED IN THE KINGDOM OF LYDIA DURING A TIME OF FAMINE APPARENTLY THERE WAS SUCH A SEVERE FAMINE
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0077070-0077989.wav THE KING OF LYDIA DECIDED THEY HAD TO DO SOMETHING CRAZY PEOPLE WERE SUFFERING PEOPLE WERE FIGHTING IT WAS AN EXTREME SITUATION THEY NEEDED AN EXTREME SOLUTION
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0077989-0078605.wav SO ACCORDING TO RATIUS THEY INVENTED DICE GAMES AND THEY SET UP A KINGDOM WIDE POLICY
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0078605-0079841.wav ON ONE DAY EVERYBODY WOULD EAT AND ON THE NEXT DAY EVERYBODY WOULD PLAY GAMES AND THEY WOULD BE SO IMMERSED IN PLAYING THE DICE GAMES BECAUSE GAMES ARE SO ENGAGING AND MERCILESS AND SUCH SATISFYING BLISSFUL PRODUCTIVITY
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0079841-0080708.wav THEY WOULD IGNORE THE FACT THAT THEY HAD NO FOOD TO EAT AND THEN ON THE NEXT DAY THEY WOULD PLAY GAMES AND ON THE NEXT DAY THEY WOULD EAT AND ACCORDING TO HERODOTUS
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0080708-0081759.wav THEY PASSED EIGHTEEN YEARS THIS WAY SURVIVING THERE WERE FAMINE BY EATING ON ONE DAY AND PLAYING GAMES ON THE NEXT NOW THIS IS EXACTLY I THINK HOW ARE YOU IN GAMES TODAY
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0081759-0082734.wav WE'RE USING GAMES TO ESCAPE REAL WORLD SUFFERING WE'RE USING GAMES TO GET AWAY FROM EVERYTHING THAT'S BROKEN IN REAL ENVIRONMENT EVERYTHING THAT'S NOT SATISFYING ABOUT REAL LIFE
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0082734-0084216.wav AND WE'RE GETTING WHAT WE NEED FROM GAMES BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO END THERE THIS IS REALLY EXCITING ACCORDING TO HERODOTUS AFTER EIGHTEEN YEARS THE FAMINE WASN'T GETTING BETTER SO THE KING DECIDED THEY WOULD PLAY ONE FINE OLD GAME
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0084216-0084925.wav THEY DIVIDED THE ENTIRE KINGDOM IN HALF THEY PLAYED ONE DICE GAME AND THE WINNERS OF THAT GAME GOT TO GO
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0084925-0085744.wav ON AN EPIC ADVENTURE THEY WOULD LEAVE LYDIA AND THEY WOULD GO OUT IN SEARCH OF A NEW PLACE TO LIVE LEAVING BEHIND JUST ENOUGH PEOPLE
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0085744-0086551.wav TO SURVIVE ON THE RESOURCES THAT WERE AVAILABLE AND HOPEFULLY TO TAKE THEIR CIVILIZATION SOMEWHERE ELSE WHERE THEY COULD THRIVE NOW THIS SOUNDS CRAZY
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0086551-0087544.wav BUT RECENTLY D AND A EVIDENCE HAS SHOWN THAT THE ETRUSCANS WHO THEN LED TO THE ROMAN EMPIRE ACTUALLY SHARE THE SAME DYNAE AS THE ANCIENT LYDIANS AND SO
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0087544-0089009.wav RECENTLY SCIENTISTS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT HERODOTUS'S CRAZY STORY IS ACTUALLY TRUE AND GEOLOGISTS HAVE FOUND EVIDENCE OF A GLOABLE COOLING THAT LASTED FOR NEARLY TWENTY YEARS THAT COULD HAVE EXPLAINED THE FAMINE SO THIS CRAZY STORY MIGHT BE TRUE THEY MIGHT HAVE ACTUALLY
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0089009-0090306.wav SAVED THEIR CULTURE BY PLAYING GAMES ESCAPING TO GAMES FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS AND THEN BEEN SO INSPIRED AND AND KNEW SO MUCH ABOUT HOW TO COME TOGETHER WITH GAMES THAT THEY ACTUALLY SAVED THE ENTIRE CIVILIZATION THEY WERE OH YES WE CAN DO THAT
JaneMcGonigal_2010-0090306-0091140.wav WE HAVE BEEN PLAYING WAR CRAFT SINCE NINETEEN NINETY FOUR THAT WAS THE FIRST REAL TIME STRATEGY GAME FROM THE WORLD WARFARES THAT WAS SIXTEEN YEARS AGO

RobertGupta_2010U-0001680-0002348.wav ONE DAY LOS ANGELES TIMES COME AS STEVE LOPEZ WAS WALKING ALONG THE STREETS OF DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES WHEN HE HEARD
RobertGupta_2010U-0002348-0002746.wav BEAUTIFUL MUSIC AND THE SOURCE WAS A MAN
RobertGupta_2010U-0002746-0003645.wav AN AMERICAN MAN CHARMING RUGGED HOMELESS PLAYING A VIOLIN THAT ONLY HAD TWO STRINGS
RobertGupta_2010U-0003645-0004367.wav I AM TELLING A STORY THAT MANY OF YOU KNOW BECAUSE STEVE'S COLUMNS BECAME THE BASIS FOR A BOOK WHICH WAS TURNED INTO A MOVIE

RobertGupta_2010U-0005744-0007210.wav NATHANIEL DROPPED OUT OF JULIAN HE SUFFERED A COMPLETE BREAK DOWN AND THIRTY YEARS LATER HE WAS LIVING HOMELESS ON THE STREETS OF SKID ROW IN DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES I ENCOURAGE ALL OF YOU TO READ STEVE'S BOOK OR TO WATCH THE MOVIE TO UNDERSTAND NOT ONLY THE BEAUTIFUL BOND
RobertGupta_2010U-0007210-0008348.wav THAT FORM BETWEEN THESE TWO MEN BUT HOW MUSIC HELP SHAPED THAT BOND AND ULTIMATELY WAS INSTRUMENTAL IF YOU'LL PARDON THE PUN IN HELPING THE THING TO GET OFF THE STREETS
RobertGupta_2010U-0008348-0010750.wav I MET MISTER EYRES IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TWO YEARS AGO AT WALTISNEY CONCERT HALL HE HAD JUST HEARD A PERFORMANCE OF BEETHOVEN'S FIRST AND FORT SYMPHONIES AND CAME BACK STAGE AND INTRODUCED HIMSELF WHEN SPEAKING IN A VERY JOVIAL AND GREGARIOUS WAY ABOUT YOKOHAMA AND HILARY CLINTON AND HOW THE DODGERS WERE NEVER GOING TO MAKE THE WORLD'S SERIES ALL BECAUSE OF THE TREACHEROUS FIRST VIOLIN PASSAGE WORK IN THE LAST MOVEMENT OF BEETHOVEN'S FOURTH SYMPHONY
RobertGupta_2010U-0010750-0011922.wav AND WE GOT TALKING ABOUT MUSIC AND I GOT AN IDEA FROM STEVE A FEW DAYS LATER SAYING THAT NATHANIEL WAS INTERESTED IN A VIOLIN LESSON WITH ME NOW I SHOULD MENTION THAT NATHANIEL REFUSES TREATMENT
RobertGupta_2010U-0011922-0012796.wav BECAUSE WHEN HE WAS TREATED IT WAS WITH SHOCK THEREAPY AND THORISEN AND HANDCUFFS AND THAT SCAR HAS STAYED WITH HIM FOR HIS ENTIRE LIFE
RobertGupta_2010U-0012796-0013630.wav BUT AS A RESULT NOW HE IS PRONE TO THESE KINDS OF FRANTIC EPISODES THE WORST OF WHICH CAN MANIFEST THEMSELVES AS HIM EXPLODING
RobertGupta_2010U-0013630-0014616.wav AND THEN DISAPPEARING FOR DAYS WANDERING THE STREETS OF SKID ROW EXPOSED TO ITS HORRORS WITH THE TORMENT OF HIS OWN MIND UNLEASHED UPON HIM
RobertGupta_2010U-0014616-0015730.wav AND NATHANIEL WAS IN SUCH A STATE OF AGITATION WHEN WE STARTED OUR FIRST LESSON AT WALTER'S NEW CONCERT HALL HE HAD A KIND OF MANIC GLINT IN HIS EYES HE WAS LOST
RobertGupta_2010U-0015730-0017463.wav AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT INVISIBLE DEMONS AND SMOKE AND HOW SOMEONE WAS POISONING HIM IN HIS SLEEP AND I WAS AFRAID NOT FOR MYSELF BUT I WAS AFRAID THAT I WAS TO LOSE HIM THAT HE WAS GOING TO SINK INTO ONE OF HIS STATES
RobertGupta_2010U-0017463-0018319.wav AND THAT I WOULD RUIN HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE VIOLIN IF I STARTED TALKING ABOUT SCALES AND ARPEGGIOS AND OTHER EXCITING FORMS OF DIDACTIC PEDAGOGY
RobertGupta_2010U-0018419-0018704.wav SO I JUST STARTED PLAYING
RobertGupta_2010U-0018704-0019867.wav AND I PLAYED THE FIRST MOVEMENT OF THE BAIT OF A MELANCHOLY CONCERT AND AS I PLAYED I UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE WAS A PROFOUND CHANGE OCCURRING IN NATHANIEL'S EYES
RobertGupta_2010U-0019867-0020541.wav IT WAS AS IF HE WAS IN THE GRIP OF SOME INVISIBLE PHARMACEUTICAL A CHEMICAL REACTION FOR WHICH MY PLAYING THE MUSIC
RobertGupta_2010U-0020541-0021229.wav WAS ITS CATALIST AND NATHANIEL'S MANIC RAGE
RobertGupta_2010U-0021229-0022001.wav WAS TRANSFORMED INTO UNDERSTANDING A QUIET CURIOSITY AND GRACE
RobertGupta_2010U-0022001-0023301.wav AND IN A MIRACLE HE LIFTED HIS OWN VIOLIN AND HE STARTED PLAYING BY EAR CERTAIN SNIPPETS OF VIOLIN CONCERTOS WHICH HE THEN ASKED ME TO COMPLETE MENDELSSOHN TSCHAIKOVSKI SABAS
RobertGupta_2010U-0023301-0024553.wav AND WE STARTED TALKING ABOUT MUSIC FROM BACH TO BEETHOVEN AND BRAHMS BROOKLYN AND ALL THE BEES FROM BACHTOCK ALL THE WAY UP TO ESPECACEL AND I UNDERSTOOD THAT HE NOT ONLY HAD AN ENCYCLOPEDIC KNOWLEDGE OF MUSIC
RobertGupta_2010U-0024553-0025550.wav BUT HE RELATED TO THIS MUSIC AT A PERSONAL LEVEL HE SPOKE ABOUT IT WITH A KIND OF PASSION AND UNDERSTANDING THAT I SHARE WITH MY COLLEAGUES IN THE LOS ANGELES PHIL
RobertGupta_2010U-0025550-0026143.wav AND THROUGH PLAYING MUSIC AND TALKING ABOUT MUSIC THIS MAN HAD TRANSFORMED
RobertGupta_2010U-0026143-0026945.wav FROM THE PARANOID DISTURBED MAN THAT HAD JUST COME FROM WALKING THE STREETS OF DANTE LOS ANGELES TO THE CHARMING
RobertGupta_2010U-0026945-0027836.wav ERUDITE BRILLIANT JULIA TRAINED MUSICIAN MUSIC IS MEDICINE
RobertGupta_2010U-0027836-0029180.wav MUSIC CHANGES US AND FOR NATHANIEL MUSIC IS SANITY BECAUSE MUSIC ALLOWS HIM TO TAKE HIS THOUGHTS AND DELUSIONS AND SHAPE THEM THROUGH HIS IMAGINATION AND HIS CREATION INTO REALITY
RobertGupta_2010U-0029180-0029611.wav AND THAT IS AN ESCAPE FROM HIS TORMENTED STATE
RobertGupta_2010U-0029611-0030712.wav AND I UNDERSTOOD THAT THIS WAS THE VERY ESSENCE OF ART THIS WAS THE VERY REASON WHY WE MADE MUSIC THAT WE TAKE SOMETHING THAT EXISTS WITHIN ALL OF US AT OUR VERY CORE OUR EMOTIONS
RobertGupta_2010U-0030712-0031379.wav AND THROUGH OUR ARTISTIC ENDS THROUGH OUR CREATIVEITY WE ARE ABLE TO SHAPE THOSE EMOTIONS INTO REALITY
RobertGupta_2010U-0031379-0032294.wav AND THE REALITY OF THAT EXPRESSION REACHES ALL OF US AND MOVES US INSPIRES AND UNITES US
RobertGupta_2010U-0032294-0032808.wav AND FOR NATHANIEL MUSIC BROUGHT HIM BACK INTO A FOLD OF FRIENDS
RobertGupta_2010U-0032808-0033863.wav THE REDEMPTIVE POWER OF MUSIC BROUGHT HIM BACK INTO A FAMILY OF MUSICIANS THAT UNDERSTOOD HIM THAT RECOGNIZED HIS TALENTS AND RESPECTED HIM
RobertGupta_2010U-0033863-0035117.wav AND I WILL ALWAYS MAKE MUSIC WITH NATHANIEL WHETHER WE ARE AT ONCE IN A CONCERT HALL OR ON SKID ROW BECAUSE HE REMINDS ME WHY I BECAME A MUSICIAN THANK YOU

TomWujec_2010U-0001626-0004156.wav THREE YEARS AGO HERE AT TED PETER'S SKILLMAN INTRODUCED A DESIGNED CHALLENGE CALLED THE MARSHMALLOW CHALLENGE AND THE IDEA IS PRETTY SIMPLE TEAMS OF FOUR HAVE TO BUILD A TALLEST FREE STANDING STRUCTURE OUT OF TWENTY STICKS A SPAGHETTI ONE YARD OF TAPE ONE YARD OF STRING AND A MARSHMALLOW THE MARSHMALLOW HAS TO BE ON TOP AND THOUGH IT SEEMS REALLY SIMPLE IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY HARD BECAUSE IT FORCES PEOPLE TO COLLABORATE VERY QUICKLY
TomWujec_2010U-0004156-0004920.wav AND SO I THOUGHT THIS WAS AN INTERESTING IDEA AND I INCORPORATED INTO A DESIGN WORKSHOP AND IT WAS A HUGE SUCCESS AND SINCE THEN I
TomWujec_2010U-0004920-0006666.wav CONDUCTED ABOUT SEVENTY DESIGN WORKSHOPS ACROSS THE WORLD WITH STUDENTS AND DESIGNERS AND ARCHITECTS EVEN THE STUDIOS OF THE FOURTEEN FIFTY AND THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THIS EXERCISE THAT REVEALS VERY DEEP LESSONS ABOUT THE NATURE OF COLLABORATION AND I LIKE TO SHARE SOME OF THEM WITH YOU SO
TomWujec_2010U-0006666-0008700.wav NORMALLY MOST PEOPLE BEGIN BY ORIENTING THEMSELVES TO THE TASK THEY TALK ABOUT IT THEY FORGET WHAT IT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE THEY JOCKEY FOR POWER THEN THEY SPEND SOME TIME PLANNING ORGANIZING THEY SKETCH IN THEY LAY OUTS FORGETTING THEY'D SPEND THE MAJORITY OF THEIR TIME ASSEMBLING THE STICKS INTO EVER GROWING STRUCTURES AND THEN
TomWujec_2010U-0008700-0009587.wav FINALLY JUST AS THE RUNNING OUT OF TIME SOME ONE TAKES OUT THE MARSHMALLOW AND THEN THEY GINGERLY PUT IT ON TOP AND THEY STAND BACK
TomWujec_2010U-0009587-0009748.wav
TomWujec_2010U-0009748-0010954.wav THEY ADMIRE THEIR WORK BUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENS MOST OF THE TIME IS THAT THE TOAD TURNS INTO AN O BECAUSE THE WEIGHT OF THE MARSHMALLOW CAUSES THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE TO BUCKLE AND TO COLLAPSE SO
TomWujec_2010U-0010954-0011682.wav THERE ARE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO'D HAVE A LOT MORE O MOMENTS THAN OTHERS AND AMONG THE WORST ARE RECENT GRADUATES OF BUSINESS SCHOOL
TomWujec_2010U-0011938-0013152.wav THEY LIE THERE'S A SHEET THEY GET DISTRACTED THEY'VE DONE THEY PRODUCE REALLY LAMED STRUCTURES AND OF COURSE THERE'S TEAMS THAT HAVE A LOT MORE TO DOLL STRUCTURES AND AMONG THE BEST ARE RECENT GRADUATES OF KINDERGARTEN
TomWujec_2010U-0013299-0013334.wav
TomWujec_2010U-0013481-0014491.wav IT'S PRETTY AMAZING AS PETER TELLS US THAT NOT ONLY DID THEY PRODUCE THE TALLEST STRUCTURES BUT THE MOST INTERESTING STRUCTURES OF THEM ALL SO THE QUESTION WHEN ASKED IS HOW COME
TomWujec_2010U-0014491-0015269.wav WHY WHAT IS IT ABOUT THEM AND PETER LIKES TO SAY THAT NONE OF US AND NONE OF THE KIDS SPEND ANY TIME TRYING TO BE SEA EELS PEGGY INK
TomWujec_2010U-0015269-0016219.wav RIGHT THEY DON'T TIME SPEND TIME JOGGING FOR POWER BUT THERE'S ANOTHER REASON AS WELL AND THE REASON IS THAT BUSINESS STUDENTS ARE TRAINED TO FIND THE SINGLE RIGHT PLAN
TomWujec_2010U-0016219-0016949.wav THEN THEY EXECUTE ON IT AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS WHEN THEY PUT THE MARSHMALLOW ON TOP THEY RUN OUT OF TIME AND WHAT HAPPENS IT'S A CRISIS
TomWujec_2010U-0017131-0017995.wav SOUND FAMILIAR WRITE WHAT KINDER GARDENERS DO DIFFERENTLY IS THAT THEY START WITH THE MARSHMALLOW AND THEY BUILD PROTOTYPES SUCCESSIVE PROTOTYPES
TomWujec_2010U-0017995-0018863.wav ALWAYS KEEPING THE MARSHMALLOW IN TOPS OF THE OF MULTIPLE TIMES ADD TO TO FIX IN THE BILL PROTOTYPES ALONG THE WAY SO AS I NEVER RECOGNISE THIS TYPE OF COLLABORATION
TomWujec_2010U-0018863-0019612.wav AS THE ESSENCE OF THE ITERATIVE PROCESS AND WITH EACH VERSION KIDS GET INSTANT FEED BACK ABOUT WHAT WORKS AND WHAT DOESN'T WORK
TomWujec_2010U-0019612-0020200.wav SO THE CAPACITY TO PLAY AND PROTOTYPE IS REALLY ESSENTIAL BUT LET'S LOOK AT HOW DIFFERENT TEAMS PERFORM
TomWujec_2010U-0020200-0021385.wav SO THE AVERAGE FOR MOST PEOPLE IS ABOUT TWENTY INCHES BUSINESS SCHOOLS DIDN'T AMOUNT TO HALF OF THAT LAWYERS LITTLE BETTER BUT NOT MUCH BETTER THAN THAT KINDERGARTEN BETTER THAN MOST ADULTS WHO DOES THE VERY BEST
TomWujec_2010U-0021385-0021767.wav ARCHITECTS AND ENGINEERS THANKFUL
TomWujec_2010U-0022235-0023455.wav THIRTY NINE INCHES OF THE TALLEST STRUCTURE I'VE SEEN AND WHY IS IT BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND TRIANGLES AND SELF REINFORCING GEOMETRICAL PATTERNS OR THE KEY TO BUILDING SELF OR REINFORCED AT THE STABLE STRUCTURES
TomWujec_2010U-0023455-0024381.wav SO I SEE YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN AVERAGE BUT HERE'S WHAT GETS INTERESTING IF YOU PUT IN AN EXECUTIVE ADMEN ON THE TEAM THEY GET SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER
TomWujec_2010U-0024554-0024688.wav YOU KNOW
TomWujec_2010U-0024688-0026094.wav LOOK AROUND TO GO OUT THAT TEAM'S GOIN TO DO TELL BEFOREHAND AND WHY'S THAT BECAUSE THEY HAVE SPECIAL SKILLS OF FACILITATION THEY MANAGE THE PROCESS THEY UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS AND ANY TEAM WHO MANAGES AND PAYS A CLOSE ATTENTION TO WORK
TomWujec_2010U-0026094-0027044.wav I WILL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE TEAMS PERFORMERS SPECIALIZED SKILLS AND FACILITATION SKILLS AS THE COMBINATION LEADS TO TO STRONG SUCCESS
TomWujec_2010U-0027044-0027776.wav IF YOU'RE TEN TEAMS SO TYPICALLY PERFORMED YOU'LL GET ME SIX OR SO THAT OF STANDING STRUCTURES AND I I'D TRY SOMETHING INTERESTING I THOUGHT LET'S
TomWujec_2010U-0027776-0028693.wav UP THE ANTE ONCE SO I OFFERED A TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR PRIZE A SOFT WORD TO THE WINNING TEAM SO WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED TO THESE DESIGNED STUDENTS WHAT WAS THE RESULT
TomWujec_2010U-0028693-0029055.wav YES WHAT HAPPENED
TomWujec_2010U-0029055-0031142.wav NOT ONE TEAM HAD A STANDING STRUCTURE NOT ONE HAD A IF ANY ONE HAD BUILT SAY A A ONE INSTRUCTOR THAT IT WOULD HAVE SHAKEN ON THE PRIZE SO ISN'T IT INTERESTING THAT HIGH STAKES I HAVE A STRONG IMPACT WE DID THE EXERCISE AGAIN WITH THE SAME STUDENTS WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED THEN SO NOW THEY UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF PROTOTYPING
TomWujec_2010U-0031142-0032519.wav SO THE SAME TEAM WENT FROM BEING THE VERY WORST TO BEING AMONG THE VERY BEST THEY PRODUCED THE TALLEST STRUCTURES IN THE LEAST AMOUNT OF TIME SO THERE IS A GREAT LESSONS FOR US ABOUT THE NATURE OF INCENTIVES AND SUCCESS
TomWujec_2010U-0032519-0033857.wav SO YOU MIGHT ASK WHY WOULD ANY ONE ACTUALLY SPEND TIME RUNNING A MARSHMALLOW A CHALLENGE AND THE REASON IS I HELPED GREAT DIGITAL TOOLS AND PROCESSES TO HELP THE TEAMS BUILD CARS AND VITIO GAMES AND VISUAL EFFECTS A
TomWujec_2010U-0033857-0034512.wav AND WHAT THE MARSHMALLOW CHALLENGE DOES THAT HELPS HIM IDENTIFY THE HIDDEN ASSUMPTIONS BECAUSE FRANKLY
TomWujec_2010U-0034512-0036927.wav EVERY PROJECT HAS ITS OWN MARSHMALLOW ISN'T IT THAT THE CHALLENGE PROVIDES A SHARE OF EXPERIENCE A COMMON LANGUAGE A COMMON SENSE TO BUILD THE RIGHT PROTOTYPE AND SO THIS IS THE VALUE OF THE EXPERIENCE OF THIS SO SIMPLE EXERCISE AND THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE INTERESTED MAY WHEN YOU GO TO MARSHMALLOW CHALLENGED OUR COMMENTS A BLOCK THAT YOU CAN LOOK AT HOW TO BUILD AT THE MARSHMALLOWS OR STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS ON THIS A THERE ARE
TomWujec_2010U-0036927-0037543.wav CRAZY EXAMPLES FROM AROUND THE WORLD OF HOW PEOPLE SPEAK AND ADJUST THE SYSTEM OF THE WORLD RECORDS THAT ARE ON THIS AS WELL
TomWujec_2010U-0037543-0040217.wav AND THE FUNDAMENTAL LESSON I BELIEVE IS THAT DESIGN TRULY IS A CONTEXT SPORT AH IT DEMANDS THAT WE BRING ALL OF OUR SENSES TO THE TASK AND THAT WE APPLY THE VERY BEST OF OUR THINKING OUR FEELING AND OUR DOING TO THE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE AT HAND AND SOMETIMES A LITTLE PROTOTYPE OF THIS EXPERIENCE IS ALL THAT IT TAKES TO TURN US FROM A MOMENT TO A TIDAL MOMENT AND THAT CAN MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE
